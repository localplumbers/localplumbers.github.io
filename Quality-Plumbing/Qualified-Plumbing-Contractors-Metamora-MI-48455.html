Smaller capacity models combine the mineral tank and brine tanks into one cabinet, but the two tanks are still separated within the cabinet. During the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water created in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design).</p>

Many communities recommend that organic wastes are best thrown away in the standard trash rather than ground up and flushed down the sink. Since natural gas is colorless and odorless, a chemical called mercaptan is added to your gas supply to produce that rotten egg smell that alerts you to a gas leak.</p>
<p>With video camera inspections, diagnosing a problem with the sewer system is simple and doesn't involve invasive digging or cutting. A Kinetico water softener will provide your family with abundant, clean, safe water on demand.

<p>The water valves are turned off in order to cut off the supply of water to the sink when the repair work is ongoing. While not a pleasant experience, a hand auger can reach between 2 to 5 feet down the toilet's drain pipe to break-up or retrieve things (such as Junior's action figure) that are blocking the pipe. Another factor that contributes to the cost of the repair is the decision whether the gas line should be extended or should be replaced as a whole.</p>
