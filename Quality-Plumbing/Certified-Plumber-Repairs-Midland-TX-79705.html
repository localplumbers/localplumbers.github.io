Each model in their collection focuses on one essential feature of water softening and they come in a big range of sizes.

Hard water is converted into soft water by exchanging hard salts of calcium and magnesium with sodium using an ion-exchange process.</p>

Next, water goes through the reverse osmosis membrane where dissolved particles, even too small to be seen with an electron microscope, are removed. 12 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning". Essentially the most significant difference between normal osmosis and reverse osmosis lies in pressure.</p>
