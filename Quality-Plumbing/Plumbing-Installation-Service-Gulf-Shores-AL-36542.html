<p>Unlike other methods, the method of the invention does not replace removed ions with sodium ions. The resin beads chemically attract the unwanted ‘hard' mineral ions and exchange them with sodium ions.

Pressure is applied to the solution with a higher solids concentration to cause the flow of liquid to reverse (from concentrate to permeate), unlike natural osmosis.

<p>The brine solution flows through the resin tank, rinsing the beads and exchanging new sodium for the hard water minerals that have collected. Today, Mr. Fox replaced one faucet, repaired another and fixed a small leak. Your hot water is rust-colored: This is likely a sign that the inside of your tank is rusting, which means it's aging and breaking down.
