Formally, reverse osmosis is the process of forcing a solvent from a region of high solute concentration through a semipermeable membrane to a region of low-solute concentration by applying a pressure in excess of the osmotic pressure. Plumbing issues caused by clogged sewer drains can be expensive and frustrating for homeowners.</p>

After the septic tank and the distribution boxes are in place, the septic tank installers put in the sewer lines from the house to the tank and from the tank to the distribution boxes.</p>
