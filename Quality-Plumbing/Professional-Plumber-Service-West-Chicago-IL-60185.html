The maintenance of the septic tank system is not very difficult and tedious until the solid waste is accumulated and the decaying bacteria are destroyed. The main line is responsible for collecting all the debris of the other drains that are connected to it and for flushing the debris in the city sewer systems or to a private septic tank.</p>
<p>Another important role of salt is to help soften our water. Broken pipes can cause a break in the drainage flow, which can also allow dirt and rocks to clog the line.

<p>Naturally, sooner or later, the resins will not be able to replace calcium and magnesium, since there will not be any more (or a very little quantity) ions of sodium available for exchange. The resin is cleared by flushing a strong sodium (salt) solution held in the brine tank. Heat Pump Water Heaters Heat pump water heaters will significantly increase energy efficiency. The regeneration water is a solution of sodium chloride (common kitchen salt); it flows through the resins and is carried to drain with addiction of calcium and magnesium released from resins.</p>
