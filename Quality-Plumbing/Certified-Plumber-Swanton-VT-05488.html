The reverse osmosis water filter was designed to remove salt, minerals and larger molecular particles from public drinking water.</p>
<p>Likewise, don't run the sewage into a sinkhole or drainage well as this pollutes the groundwater. However, water with high TDS content and iron levels will demand more salt to effectively soften. For example, horizontal septic tanks should not be placed in a trafficable area. We also offer full installation and replacement services for pipes, drains, faucets, toilets, sinks, garbage disposals, and water heaters.</p>
<p>Softening is achieved by adding lime in the form of Ca(OH)2, which reacts first with CO2 to form calcium carbonate precipitate, and then reacts with multivalent cations to remove carbonate hardness, then reacts with anions to replace the non-carbonate hardness due to multivalent cations with non-carbonate hardness due to calcium. You need to be aware, however, that all installation of septic systems and tanks requires permission.</p>
