Also, pour a little water into the sump pit and make sure the pump turns on and clears the water quickly.

After the drain line has been properly cleaned or fixed, the video inspection can be repeated to ensure that the service was successfully done.</p>
<p>Video cameras are useful in locating buried septic systems or inspecting the condition of buried pipes to determine proper maintenance schedules or the extent of necessary repairs. The installation of garbage grinders, large volume hot tubs or spas are not recommended unless the septic system has been sized to accommodate their use. However, both are efficient and reliable heaters. There aren't many conveniences in a modern home that get more of a workout than the kitchen sink, and it's a real problem when it stops working properly, either because it's leaking, stopped up, or the faucet won't give you water.</p>
<p>By contrast, waste from garbage disposers is 70 percent to 90 percent water; it can be cleaned and put back into the water system via specialized treatment facilities, some of which are outfitted with technology that capture methane gas generated by decomposition of organic matter, thus turning biogas into fuel.
