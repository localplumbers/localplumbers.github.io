<p>It is rare to have a main sewer line stoppage and still have your toilets working properly. These kinds of clogs can often be manually removed by using an auger or drain snake. Clogged toilets are one of the more common issues our clients have and the majority of the time these problems can be solved with the use of a plunger.

This is due to the fact that tankless water heaters can continuously heat water, unlike tank heaters, which are only able to heat as much water as fits in the tank. Septic tanks do not require any real hands on maintenance except of course unless they break down.

A lot of commercial plumbing jobs are more repetitive than residential plumbing is because they can be done in large plants where the same type of equipment is used for many different applications.</p>
