Welcome to Eagle and plumbing, one of the region's top professional plumbing company, and home of the amazing bio cleaning organic plumbing system.

<p>The popup stopper in many bathroom sinks and tubs can also build up this "gunk". To look for trapped air running water in the sink that is closest to the toilet is a good idea.
