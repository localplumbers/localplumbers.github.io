Some types may be fitted with uncovered chrome pipes rather than recessed pipes, making retrofitting these kinds of showers simpler and easier in several applications. Reduced Energy Consumption - Unlike traditional reverse osmosis systems that operate at constant high pressure, Desalitech systems start each batch at a low pressure which is gradually increased during the batch as concentration in the systems builds up. This leads to an average pressure which is lower than the constant pressure of traditional reverse osmosis.</p>

<p>Reverse osmosis systems work by pushing tap water through a membrane or film that has tiny holes in it. In theory, only pure water molecules can pass through the tiny holes, leaving pollutants, little organisms and minerals on the dirty side of the membrane. We clear debris and fix broken pipes leaving your home that can cause thousands of dollars in property damage. There are three signs you have sediment buildup in your tank: A lower element burnout if you have an electric water heater, A lot of noise if you have a gas water heater, or a foul odor coming from both types of water heaters.</p>
