<p>A sump pump is a piece of equipment that plays a huge role in keeping flood- and leak-prone basements dry. You'll understand why you need a plumber's help when you go to lift a fifty-pound toilet off of the base to replace the wax ring, and then try to set it back down on the bolts without being able to see the bolts or the wax ring. If you are concerned about whether or not your blocked drain is a health risk, a professional drain cleaning company will give good advice, or contact your local Environmental Health Department.</p>
<p>The application includes the following information: the business name and address, owner name and address, owner's physical description, number and type of machines operated, county where applicant will conduct most business, types of SSDS systems, approximate number of systems installed in previous year, anyone authorized under the permit.
