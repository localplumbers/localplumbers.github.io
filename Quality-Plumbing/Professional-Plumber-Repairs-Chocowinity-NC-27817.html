Hydro-jetting uses high-powered water to clean the entire drain. The amount of sodium that gets released into a gallon of softened water is about as much as what you'd find in 2 slices of white bread.</p>
<p>All Vertical, Horizontal and Septic Tanks carry a quality certification from the Agr√©ment Board of South Africa. If you get your drinking water from a private well, then an RO system is an excellent way to ensure that the water flowing to your tap is safe.
