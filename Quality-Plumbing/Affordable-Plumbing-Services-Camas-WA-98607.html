<p>Each ppm of iron is equivalent to 3 to 4 grains of water hardness, and it is recommended that an ion-exchange water softener should only be used for iron removal if its concentration in the water does not exceed 5 to 6ppm, otherwise an iron filter should be used in conjunction with the water softener. This is a good option for wider sump pumps. A garbage disposal unit has become very common in most homes due to the various benefits it provides to homeowners.</p>
