<p>Naturally, sooner or later, the resins will not be able to replace calcium and magnesium, since there will not be any more (or a very little quantity) ions of sodium available for exchange. The resin is cleared by flushing a strong sodium (salt) solution held in the brine tank. Heat Pump Water Heaters Heat pump water heaters will significantly increase energy efficiency.
