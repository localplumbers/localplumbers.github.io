<p>2. Pipe Wrench: A pipe wrench is one of the most common tools used by plumbers. However, certain issues with your water heater may indicate that it's time for a replacement. Maybe not, but landlords may still be reluctant to install the fixtures because of first-time installation costs (which can exceed $600), concerns about maintenance, or because they simply aren't aware disposers are permitted to begin with.</p>
