This gives the feeling of softer water on the skin, even if the chemical composition is not changed.</p>
<p>Our highly skilled plumber inserts a high-resolution video camera that is designed to travel through the pipe to see inside the entire pipe. A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that removes hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a process called ion exchange.

<p>In the Salt-Free Water Softeners article, you'll also find a discussion of a more controversial option—the electronic or magnetic water softener or descaler. If a drain clog is especially difficult, including built-up grease, grit and debris that won't respond to a drain snake auger, then high-pressure water jetting may be in order. The tungsten compound would then be reused to recharge the water-softening columns.</p>

The water supply line feeds the hard water into the tank. Many types of garbage disposals begin to wear out after more than a decade and can be replaced with a little organization and elbow grease. They have been replaced by more efficient, more effective multi-stage filtration units that can outperform the RO units and provide years of clean, pure, healthy water.</p>
