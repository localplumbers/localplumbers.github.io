<p>Grease can build up very quickly in restaurants, in some restaurants as fast as 3 months a sewer line can become impacted with grease causing the bar area to flood and the floor drains in the bathrooms to over flow with sewer water. Indeed, a small profit can be derived from the regeneration process since the chemicals generated can be sold for more than the cost of the chemicals used. In case if the water remains standing on the shower base, then there are possibilities of a soapy film which can form and it would then create a slipping hazard, hence there is a need wherein the base should be designed with a downward slope that goes towards the drain at all of the points.</p>
