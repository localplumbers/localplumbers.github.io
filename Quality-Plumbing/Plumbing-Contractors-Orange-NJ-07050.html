Many communities recommend that organic wastes are best thrown away in the standard trash rather than ground up and flushed down the sink. Since natural gas is colorless and odorless, a chemical called mercaptan is added to your gas supply to produce that rotten egg smell that alerts you to a gas leak.</p>

We also perform sump pump maintenance, which could mean the difference between a bone-dry basement or thousands of dollars worth of water damage in your home.

The lines will definitely contain gas residues, and it this will require you to remove it in order to relieve the pipe.</p>
