After following them on Instagram for a while and seeing how meticulous and precise some of their other systems are in the bus, I was excited to learn about their plumbing and bathroom setup that can handle full-time use by six people.

Sump pumps range in cost, effectiveness, and visibility, so you can choose one that best fits your needs and basement layout.
