A septic tank consists of one or more concrete or plastic tanks of between 4000 and 7500 litres (1,000 and 2,000 gallons); one end is connected to an inlet wastewater pipe and the other to a septic drain field Generally these pipe connections are made with a T pipe, allowing liquid to enter and exit without disturbing any crust on the surface.</p>
