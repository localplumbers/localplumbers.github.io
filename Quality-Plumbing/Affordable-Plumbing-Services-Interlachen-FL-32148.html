<p>The pressure is powerful enough to clear your pipes of calcified clogs and tree roots, but it is not powerful enough to create additional damage to your pipe. Removing a sink trap—a P-, J-, or S-shaped pipe that connects to two other pipes beneath the basin—is often the key to common plumbing repairs like unclogging a sink, because that's where most clogs lodge Or if someone drops a ring or other valuable down the drain, you're likely to find it caught in the trap.</p>

<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Interlachen FL 32148</h3>
<p>In the Salt-Free Water Softeners article, you'll also find a discussion of a more controversial option—the electronic or magnetic water softener or descaler. If a drain clog is especially difficult, including built-up grease, grit and debris that won't respond to a drain snake auger, then high-pressure water jetting may be in order. The tungsten compound would then be reused to recharge the water-softening columns.</p>
<p>Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) are the two water hardness-causing minerals. Both models don't cause a slimy or slippery feeling like that of water softened with salt. Finally, the salts used for regeneration get flushed out of the system into sewers or septic systems and can be quite damaging to the environment.
