<p>Arsenic, lead, chloride, fluoride and mercury are just some of the minerals and metals that occur in drinking water that can safely be eliminated by using a whole house reverse osmosis filtration system, sometimes called RO systems. The ball faucet is the most popular type of single-handle washerless faucet in the market.

Once water is drawn from the RO faucet, the pressure in the tank drops; the shut off valve then opens to send the drinking water through the membrane while the contaminated wastewater is diverted down the drain.
