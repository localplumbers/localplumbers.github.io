In a next step the water reaches the reverse osmosis membrane, which removes minerals, lead, inorganic compounds, salt and more. With sewer video cameras and locating equipment, it's now a simple matter of calling a plumber who can locate the problem with sewer line camera inspection equipment.

Now, when the garbage disposal is operating slowly, that is, when the water is slowing going down the drain with the wastes, there is either a clog in the P-trap or in the line from the garbage disposal unit going into the wall.</p>
