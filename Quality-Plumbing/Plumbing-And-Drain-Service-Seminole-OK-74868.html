When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. Two, the 8and quot; of rain from Tropical Storm Lee caused the drain field to flow back into the septic tank causing a backup of the septic tank. The very process that the reverse osmosis faucet depends on strips out these minerals.</p>

We move swiftly to treat any repair issues fast, and if a replacement is required, we can get a new toilet in place with the speed and efficiency you expect.</p>

Once faucet is removed, clean the sink from putty and mineral deposits by scraping it off (you can use a steel wool).
