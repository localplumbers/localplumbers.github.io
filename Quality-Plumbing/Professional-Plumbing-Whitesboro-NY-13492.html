These drains get all kind of dirt, dust, leafs and debris (all kinds), and will clog these drains. Some commercial plumbing jobs require temporary plumbing facilities to use during reconstruction and repair of the existing features. Whenever something goes out through the drainage lines in our homes, it goes to the septic tank initially.</p>

All waste water tries to get to the main sewer line and so all drain pipes flow that way.</p>
