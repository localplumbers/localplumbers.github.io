Many communities recommend that organic wastes are best thrown away in the standard trash rather than ground up and flushed down the sink.

This will help you avoid unnecessary services such as high-pressure sewer jets. Usually this happens because of a clog somewhere, either in the dishwasher, sink, or disposal, so check for clogs to find the source of the issue.</p>
