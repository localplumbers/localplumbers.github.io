<p>Maintenance Tip #1 - Preparing the water heater. Water Softeners Are Cation Exchange Devices. For professional garbage disposal installation, give Mr. Rooter a call at (855) 982-2028. If you notice that the water backs up or comes up into the tub or shower when flushing your toilet, then it is a sign that your sewer drain is clogged. All WaterSense labeled toilets have met EPA's efficiency and performance requirements, meaning double-flushing and clogging should not be an issue (but remember—any toilet will clog if used as a trash can).</p>
<p>Bill Howe Plumbing has installed over 25,000 water heaters in San Diego since opening for business in 1980 and repaired just as many. Live video allows our experienced plumbers to assess any current or potential problems that could lead to a sewer line break or other leaks down the road.

<p>The tank must retain at least two days (48 hours) of sewage flow from the house; size is based on the number of bedrooms in the dwelling. Sump holes are places where water that goes to the basement or cellar seeps to get out of the house. The clean water is separated from the salt water through this semi permeable membrane that does not allow the salt and contaminants through.

<p>It's important to find a company that can help you whenever you need it.

<p>If your water heater is approaching the ten-year mark, it's time to start considering replacement services. Plumbing inspection cameras can diagnose plumbing problems in minutes, eliminating the guesswork. If a routine snaking does not clear the line, reaches a hard blockage, pulls back roots or heavy sludge, a drain specialist will recommend a sewer camera inspection.
