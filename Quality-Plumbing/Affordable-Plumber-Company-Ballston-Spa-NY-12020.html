When the calcium and magnesium from hard water builds up in your plumbing, your shower-head won't produce a nice spray of water, your water pressure will also drop.

If a drain clog is especially difficult, including built-up grease, grit and debris that won't respond to a drain snake auger, then high-pressure water jetting may be in order.

The job of the drain-waste part of the system is to carry waste water and sewage from sinks, bathtubs, showers, toilets, and water-using appliances such as dishwashers and washing machines and deliver those wastes to the septic tank or public sewer.
