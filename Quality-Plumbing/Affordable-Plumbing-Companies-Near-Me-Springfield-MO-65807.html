<p>Every homeowner has experienced that feeling of dread: there's a clog or a leak in your pipes, or your toilet stops working. So after looking into reverse osmosis systems, I found that my best choice wasn't actually the apparatus under my kitchen sink, but a comprehensive multi-stage type filter that would encompass several processes (carbon and sub-micron filtering as well as ion exchange) to make my tap water the purest possible, leaving it without toxins, while still maintaining the integrity of essential vitamins necessary for me to stay healthy.</p>
