For example, the standard directions for toilet tank flush valve replacement include, Be careful of permanently scratching the flush valve seat”, shut off main valve”, disconnect hoses”, and be careful not to crack the toilet tank.” Even if you make it this far, the only thing you can do if your new tank flush valve doesn't work is check for leaks” and make adjustments.” Suddenly, a fifty-minute project turns into an indefinitely unresolved issue.</p>
