A reputed plumbing contractor has to be well aware of the local landscape area to understand how the presence of old trees and tree roots can come in the way of plumbing lines if a new home is being built; on the other hand, if a home has old pipes which were laid before the plumbing code standards were put in place, he has also to know how to replace the old pipes with new ones that will not compromise the existing landscape but remain firm and damage free at all times.</p>
