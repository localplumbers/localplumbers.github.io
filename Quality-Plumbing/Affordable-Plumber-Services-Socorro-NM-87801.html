<p>A reverse osmosis system, not being designed for home use does not filter chlorine. A cracked or overflowing toilet that is leaking wastewater presents unsanitary conditions and causes water damage. 3. Now that you know how a home water treatment system would work with a softener, let's talk about whether you need to use a water softener.
