This is often what we think of in terms of drains—the exits for water at the bottom of your tub or sink. It pays to learn how to toilet works so you can do simple repairs yourself and save money when there is a problem. In this tank, cold water is used to fill the tank, and an element, usually near the top & bottom inside the tank is used to heat it.
