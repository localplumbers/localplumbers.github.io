In addition to drilling during the sump pumps installation, keep in mind that the appliance must be installed at the lowest point of the foundation of your home so that water will naturally migrate towards the well of the pump.</p>
<p>Softening is achieved by adding lime in the form of Ca(OH)2, which reacts first with CO2 to form calcium carbonate precipitate, and then reacts with multivalent cations to remove carbonate hardness, then reacts with anions to replace the non-carbonate hardness due to multivalent cations with non-carbonate hardness due to calcium. You need to be aware, however, that all installation of septic systems and tanks requires permission.</p>
