Not all shower faucets are the same - Unless you replace your shower handle with the same or very similar handle you may find yourself with a larger project on your hands. Of course, pumps alone are no replacement for properly installed and serviced footer drains, which will also move water away from your foundation if they are clear of debris and operating properly.

Usually, there is a partial rubber closure, known as a splashguard, on the top of the disposal unit to prevent food waste from flying back up out of the grinding chamber.</p>
