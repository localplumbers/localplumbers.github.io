If a blockage is situated within your property's system, then it's yours to deal with; however, if only part of the system is within your home's boundaries and other parts are shared with neighbouring properties, then the local water and sewage company are responsible. Please consider ongoing maintenance costs before installing a septic tank, as keeping your tank and soak area clean and well maintained can help avoid future issues.</p>
<p>If a new septic tank is necessary, and while the old tank is being crushed and disposed of (we must by law break the bottom so it will not hold water) and while the new tank is being installed.

If your sink has a garbage disposal, you need to connect the unit to the rest of the system so that any item running through the sink will then go to the disposal and through the piping.</p>
<p>It's not only a problem that uncertified plumbers are not usually qualified enough to fix big plumbing problems, but they also can be dishonest and charge you a lot for fixes that are not needed, or they do not even do. Thus, you shouldn't just decide on the lowest estimate, but alternatively look for adequate service. Carbon filters, another option, remove chlorine, but need to be changed fairly often.</p>
