New gas line installations are done for new appliances like burners, stoves, outdoor lighting, and grills. High quality RO bottled water (and not the tap water that is simply bottled ) has to go through lots of pre-filters, an RO membrane, sometimes ending with UV light for further sterilization before getting into the shell.</p>
