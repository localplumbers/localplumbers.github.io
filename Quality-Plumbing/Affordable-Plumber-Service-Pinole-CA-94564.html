Reduced Energy Consumption - Unlike traditional reverse osmosis systems that operate at constant high pressure, Desalitech systems start each batch at a low pressure which is gradually increased during the batch as concentration in the systems builds up. This leads to an average pressure which is lower than the constant pressure of traditional reverse osmosis.</p>
<p>Besides leaks or bursting, installation of pipes in homes must also be done by a plumber as we will not have the know-how to do so. Without a plumber, we will not have the pleasure of clean running water and enjoy the basic sanitary pleasures we are so used to enjoy today.
