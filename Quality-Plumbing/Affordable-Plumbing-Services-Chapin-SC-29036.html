<p>Preventative maintenance is even more effective; regular drain cleaning in homes can stop these drains from clogging, breeding bacteria, and eventually flooding homes. However, if your toilet is particularly old or needs more frequent and costly repairs, you might need to consider upgrading to a new one.

The rub comes because the trap also traps some of the hair and soap scum we send through it. Over time, this tends to build up until, busy little beaver that it is, it dams up the drain.</p>
