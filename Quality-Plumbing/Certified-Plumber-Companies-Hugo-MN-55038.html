RO systems are pre-assembled and are used for treatment of industrial water, brackish water and seawater. Drain cleaning for exterior footer drains, however, can't be performed by the average homeowner. As already stated, this is simply the process of removing magnesium and calcium ions from water.</p>
<p>Mound systems are an option in areas of shallow soil depth, high groundwater, or shallow bedrock.
