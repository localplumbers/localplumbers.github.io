Using pumping pressure to overcome the osmotic pressure across a semipermeable membrane, these systems force water through the membrane to produce a high-quality permeate stream.</p>
<p>As in clogged toilets, the kitchen sink may also be clogged and the water would not drain due to rusty drain pipes. A major drawback of salt-based ion-exchange water softeners is the chloride they produce and discharge into septic or sewage systems.
