<p>The only time most people really spend thinking about their water heaters is in the middle of winter, when they get up in the dark to take a hot shower and they're blasted with a jet of icy water. With modern video equipment, the interior of the pipe may be inspected - this is a form of non-destructive testing A small diameter collector pipe will typically have a cleanout access at the far end and will be several hundred feet long, terminating at a manhole Additional collector pipes may discharge at this manhole and a pipe (perhaps of larger diameter) will carry the effluent to the next manhole, and so forth to a pump station or treatment plant.</p>
<p>If you are going to remodel then you should do the job properly - it is pointless to install a beautiful modern shower and have an old fashioned worn out bathtub. If you have a gas water heater, turn off the gas shutoff valve in the supply line, too, before disconnecting it. If your gas water heater has a fan unit, unplug it. If your water heater's electric, unplug it. If there's a cable connection, switch off the power first, then disconnect the cable.</p>

<p>During installation, a sump pump is placed in the pit to pump water out of the basement.
