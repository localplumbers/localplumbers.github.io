<p>Your next door neighbor was up all night dealing with a busted water heater and you just spent the last half hour listening to him complain. This purified water (permeate) is stored in a holding tank, while the water that didn't pass through the membrane, containing a high concentration of contaminants, is flushed down the drain.
