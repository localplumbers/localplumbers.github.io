<h2>How To Hire Affordable Plumbing Contractor in Bartlesville</h2>
<p>Your home is the place where you get to rest after a hard day's work. It's easy to forget about all of the items that get washed down our drains every day: hair, food, grease, and other debris which can quickly lead to stubborn clogs and cause your pipes to start backing up. Eventually, these backed-up pipes will become burst pipes, which should be avoided at all costs as they are classified as plumbing emergencies and can cause a significant amount of damage in no time at all.</p>
<p>If you suspect a leak, drain, or sewer issue underneath your slab foundation, Abacus professionals can diagnose and fix it. Signs of broken plumbing under a slab include foundation cracks, warmth under the floor, a water bill increase, or a wet area on the floor. TLC is your trusted plumbing, heating and cooling company, we have more experienced plumbers and repairmen to respond to your home or business. If the water is flowing out of the pipe or not moving at all, then it probably means that you have an existing sewer line clog.</p>
<p>An example would be flushing your toilet and your tub or shower drain starts to get backed up. This means water is trying to leave but is blocked by a sewer line clog. One of the most obvious signs that a drain is blocked is if your toilet, shower, bath or sinks are draining slowly. Our team can also help you choose the best sump pump for your property if this is the first time you are installing one.
