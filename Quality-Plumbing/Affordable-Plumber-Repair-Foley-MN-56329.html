<p>Water softening has many benefits for those who live in hard water areas and can have a direct impact on energy consumption and the environment. Softeners designed by PANDA effectively remove these hardness salts and provides a valuable return on your investment. Regular drain inspections and cleanings are recommended every three years or so.
