<p>An RO storage tank holds reverse osmosis water so you have plenty to use when you need it. A reverse osmosis system makes water slowly. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. Two, the 8and quot; of rain from Tropical Storm Lee caused the drain field to flow back into the septic tank causing a backup of the septic tank. The very process that the reverse osmosis faucet depends on strips out these minerals.</p>

<p>One wrong move could cause significant damage and cost you even more in repairs. The most common outside faucet replacements are due to a cold winter and a hose being connected to the outside faucet.
