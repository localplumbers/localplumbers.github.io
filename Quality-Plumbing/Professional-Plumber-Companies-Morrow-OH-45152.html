<p>We can remove most roots with a drain snake but if the job requires more, we can hydro jet the line and run a sewer camera to give you the best options available and most cost affective.

In addition, if your local area has recently experienced a drought or you simply haven't had to operate your sump pump in a long time, it might not be operational when needed and could need a tune-up.</p>
