<p>Plumbing refers to installing and repairing pipes and fixtures for distribution of potable water in a building. Also, pour a little water into the sump pit and make sure the pump turns on and clears the water quickly. When you apply for your building permit, the local health department official will most likely help you design the sewage disposal system and may even offer to have their office perform a soil test (LTAR) in lieu of a percolation test. The seal on the fill valve may have deteriorated due to the use of toilet cleaning tablets that are placed in the back water tank.</p>
