<p>The system operates by creating a siphon with water from the household plumbing system and pulling the water from the sump pit and sending it outside. A hole at least 2 feet deep must be excavated for your septic tank to sit in. It should be planned for the wastewater to flow downhill from here if you are installing a gravity fed system. In case of lines clogging, video inspection can help our technicians find the exact location of the clog and the factors that caused it like tree roots, so that we can come up with the best possible solution.</p>

However, if we find that the clog is way down the line, D-N-A Plumbing uses hydro jetting technology to effectively remove it.</p>
<p>The toilet is too high (our bodies were designed to squat), the sink is too low and almost useless; the shower is a deathtrap (an American dies every day from bath or shower accidents).
