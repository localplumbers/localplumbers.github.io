<p>Because enzymatic cleaners rely on liquid flowing through the pipe to disperse, they are also generally not intended to open completely clogged drains. High water levels should trigger your sump pump to begin working to redirect incoming water. Instead, they stay in suspension and are flushed out to the drain field, where they plug up the pores of the soil bed.

<p>Reverse Osmosis can be used to produce the water needed in the initial part of the process and also at the the end of the process where the waste water can be processed again using RO.

Water softening can prevent these negative effects.</p>
