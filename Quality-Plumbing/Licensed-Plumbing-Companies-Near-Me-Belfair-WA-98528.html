It pays to learn how to toilet works so you can do simple repairs yourself and save money when there is a problem. In this tank, cold water is used to fill the tank, and an element, usually near the top & bottom inside the tank is used to heat it. In between the inside tank and the outer shell is often insulation to help keep the water hot, without the elements having to do all of the work.</p>
