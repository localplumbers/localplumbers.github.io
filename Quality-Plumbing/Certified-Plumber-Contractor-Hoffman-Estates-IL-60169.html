<p>Homeowners toss an astounding amount of waste down their kitchen sinks. To my shock, I was charged $138 for Toto toilet flusher and $233 for two water heater elements. Toilets are one of the largest water consuming fixtures in your house, which means a running toilet” can waste significant amounts of water and affect your utility bills. When we arrive at your home, we'll assess the problem and present the best solution to repair your sink so it drains properly and reliably functions when you need it to.</p>
<p>If you notice your sink or tub draining slowly, or water building up in the shower, your drains need attention.

Garbage disposals themselves have become so inexpensive to purchase and install, that it just doesn't make sense to put up with the smelly trash can full of rotten food anymore.</p>
