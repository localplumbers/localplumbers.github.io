<p>Mound systems are an option in areas of shallow soil depth, high groundwater, or shallow bedrock. Leaves aren't the only culprit, however - roots from trees are notorious for growing underneath in search of water and as a result, will usually head straight to your drains. Bellied Sewer Lines - Repeat blockages occur when a part of your sewer pipe starts to sag.Sometimes this is caused by soil erosion under the pipe, foundation settlement, or poor soil compaction.</p>

<p>We don't think about them â€¦ until they break, are clogged, start leaking, or won't stop running. If you have any leaks, you can turn the water off and then tighten the plumbing drain parts a little more, or you can leave the water running as you start to tighten the plumbing drain parts, until the water isn't leaking anymore. However, they don't have the same water removal power as submersible or pedestal pumps do. Water-powered pumps can only remove 1,500 gallons or less an hour, which makes them costlier than a pedestal or submersible pumps.</p>
