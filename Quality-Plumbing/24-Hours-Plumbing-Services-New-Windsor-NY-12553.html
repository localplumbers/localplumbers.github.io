Drainfield or Distribution Pipes: Obviously the liquid material that has been partially decomposed needs somewhere to go, and this is where the distribution system, commonly referred to as a drainfield, comes in. Made up of long trenches filled with gravel or other similar material, this is the part of the overall septic system that seeps partially decomposed wastes into the surrounding soil, and transports the rest to a seepage pit.</p>

If you are doing the thermocouple installation yourself, make sure that you shut off the gas connection and give the water time to cool before doing you start working.
