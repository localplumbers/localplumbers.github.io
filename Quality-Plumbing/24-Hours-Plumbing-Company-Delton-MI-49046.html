<p>One good way to supplement your home heating system is to mount a gas wall heater. Reverse osmosis home systems go against nature. 2). Some faucets have an adapter over the stem of the valve. Natural gas is odorless, but gas companies add a chemical called mercaptan for the sole purpose of leak detection. If you're living with decreased pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and endless appliance repair bills, you need a water softener. Flushometer Services - Flushometers offer a more powerful and reliable flushing system and clog less often than residential gravity flush toilets.</p>
