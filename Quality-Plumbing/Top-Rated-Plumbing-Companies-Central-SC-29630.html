<p>The retired couple was excited at the possibility of getting help replacing their water heater. Soil-based systems are used for the discharge of liquid, effluent, which channels clean wastewater from the septic tank into perforated pipes.

Lime softening of industrial or municipal water involves mixing lime-soda with water, allowing the resulting sludge to settle, and then drawing off the clear, softened water.</p>

<p>They will take up residence inside the rim of a toilet bowl (as well as the sink and tub traps and overflows) and whenever the toilet is flushed or water run in the sink, the fresh water rushing around the toilet rim will stir up the sewer gas and push it out into the bowl.
