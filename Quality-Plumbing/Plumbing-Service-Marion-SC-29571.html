It is estimated that nearly 1 trillion gallons of water are wasted every year in the USA because of leaks.

Whether it's your water supply lines that are leaking or your sewer lines, commercial water leaks can be inconvenient and even dangerous.</p>
<p>A sewer that is root-infested or broken, or flat, can contribute to a major clog that backs up into a home or business establishment resulting in thousands of dollars in damage, repairs, and loss in property value. Putting a septic system in requires knowing about water tables, topsoil and requirements for space allowances between the house and the septic bed. All waste water tries to get to the main sewer line and so all drain pipes flow that way.</p>
