A pipe is typically formed via casting or welding , whereas a tube is made through extrusion Pipe normally has thicker walls and may be threaded or welded, while tubing is thinner-walled and requires special joining techniques such as brazing , compression fitting , crimping , or for plastics, solvent welding These joining techniques are discussed in more detail in the piping and plumbing fittings article.</p>
<p>Water filtration systems such as RO are being used more commercially due to the success they have in the industrial process. If a blockage is situated within your property's system, then it's yours to deal with; however, if only part of the system is within your home's boundaries and other parts are shared with neighbouring properties, then the local water and sewage company are responsible. Please consider ongoing maintenance costs before installing a septic tank, as keeping your tank and soak area clean and well maintained can help avoid future issues.</p>

Not only is this detrimental for the environment but, if the sludge overflows the septic tank into the leach field, it may clog the leach field piping or decrease the soil porosity itself, requiring expensive repairs. These plumbing repair articles answer nearly all questions about diagnosing and repairing building plumbing systems, including water supply and drain piping, vent piping, gas and oil piping in buildings, plumbing fixtures, water heaters, water pumps, water pressure, water softeners, water testing, water treatment equipment, water wells, and septic systems.</p>

If cleaning is required, a state-of-the-art high pressure water jetter is used to effectively and efficiently rid sewers and drains of the worst clog causing debris.</p>
<p>What surprised us was that it filtered the water in about two minutes, which is a perfect speed for filtration.
