Faucets have one primary purpose, to allow the water in your pipes to be used in a controlled manner.

<p>The sewer inspection will easily find any obstructions, clogs, leaks, offset joints, inadequate grade or breakage in the pipes. For sewer lines, these chemicals are rarely effective, and they run the risk of polluting the surrounding area if there is a leak in the pipe underground. Once they're ground, the running water flushes the particles through the grind ring and out of the disposer and into your waste water pipe.</p>
