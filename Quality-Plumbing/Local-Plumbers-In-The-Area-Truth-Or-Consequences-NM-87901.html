<p>If your reverse osmosis filtration system doesn't deliver as much water as it did when it was new and you've changed the filters and membrane, the problem may be an undercharged or leaking holding tank. Heated hard water forms a scale of calcium and magnesium minerals that can contribute to the inefficient operation or failure of water-using appliances.
