<h2>How To Hire Certified Plumbing Contractor in Brentwood</h2>
<p>Did you know that water heater problems are one of the most common reasons to call a plumber? Not all shower faucets are the same - Unless you replace your shower handle with the same or very similar handle you may find yourself with a larger project on your hands. Of course, pumps alone are no replacement for properly installed and serviced footer drains, which will also move water away from your foundation if they are clear of debris and operating properly. Tip: Place a heavy object such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation.</p>
<p>At Golden Rule Plumbing, Heating & Cooling, we offer comprehensive bathroom plumbing services throughout the Des Moines area, including the installation, replacement, repair, and maintenance of showers, toilets, bathtubs, and sinks.

Even people who live in a modern house without lead pipes can't assume their drinking water is lead-free, because in many cities there's lead in the water long before it reaches the house.

<p>Without access to a septic tank system, your property could quickly become an extremely unpleasant place to be. Once this sump crock becomes filled with water to a certain level, the sump pump will kick in and start pumping water away from your home.

<p>2. Pipe Wrench: A pipe wrench is one of the most common tools used by plumbers. However, certain issues with your water heater may indicate that it's time for a replacement. Maybe not, but landlords may still be reluctant to install the fixtures because of first-time installation costs (which can exceed $600), concerns about maintenance, or because they simply aren't aware disposers are permitted to begin with.</p>
<p>For thread-in-type elements like we show here, you'll need a water heater element wrench ($5 at home centers and hardware stores).
