Traditionally, this means water will run through a tub filled with bags of salt, usually some kind of calcium sulfate mixture, that creates a chemical reaction with the minerals in the water that make it "hard." By the time it gets to you shower, dishwasher or washing machine, the hardness is gone, and you have a nice soft water that cleans everything, rinses the soap and scum off, and leaves your hair soft and luxurious.</p>
