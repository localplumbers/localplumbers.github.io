While not a pleasant experience, a hand auger can reach between 2 to 5 feet down the toilet's drain pipe to break-up or retrieve things (such as Junior's action figure) that are blocking the pipe. Another factor that contributes to the cost of the repair is the decision whether the gas line should be extended or should be replaced as a whole.</p>
