<p>Tankless water heating units are becoming more popular due to the luxury of endless hot water and space saving applications. Septic tanks handle wastewater collection, treatment and disposal in place of it running off to the sewer line. In general, reversed osmosis is used to produce purified water to serve various purposes including beverage processing, desalination of seawater, drinking water, and production of pharmaceutical, among others.</p>
