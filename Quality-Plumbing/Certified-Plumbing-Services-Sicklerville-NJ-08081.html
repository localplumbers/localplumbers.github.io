A pipe is typically formed via casting or welding , whereas a tube is made through extrusion Pipe normally has thicker walls and may be threaded or welded, while tubing is thinner-walled and requires special joining techniques such as brazing , compression fitting , crimping , or for plastics, solvent welding These joining techniques are discussed in more detail in the piping and plumbing fittings article.</p>
