<p>However, the general principle is that you should gently feed the auger cable into your drain pipe until you hit the clog. The job of the drain-waste part of the system is to carry waste water and sewage from sinks, bathtubs, showers, toilets, and water-using appliances such as dishwashers and washing machines and deliver those wastes to the septic tank or public sewer. Some homeowners who get a home inspection expect everything in the home to be perfect after the repairs.</p>
