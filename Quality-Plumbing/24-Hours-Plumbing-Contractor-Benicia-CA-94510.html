Some sinks however have extra spouts, for soap dispensers, an air gap for the dishwasher drain, a liquid soap dispenser, a TV, well just kidding about the TV. But if some sinks have extra features that you might not want to use, you can always ask the supplier for ready made plugs to cover the unused holes, conversely, if the sink you choose doesn't have enough holes, you can easily drill a hole in your sink, or maybe have it drilled by a professional.</p>
