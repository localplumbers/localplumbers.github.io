Replace the fluid heating unit with a gas heater. Many companies that offer reverse osmosis systems also offer long-term warranties that seem too good to be true and they often are.</p>
<p>Thanks to your crew — Pat, Matt, and Rick — for a trouble-free installation, and for cleaning up and leaving the place as you found it. One more thing — I appreciate the crew's professionalism, particularly the lack of yelling, loud radio playing, and standing around in plain sight talking on a cell phone.

Now that you are done installing it, it's time to check whether the disposal is connected properly.
