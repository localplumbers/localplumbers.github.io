<p>Your home is the place where you get to rest after a hard day's work. It's easy to forget about all of the items that get washed down our drains every day: hair, food, grease, and other debris which can quickly lead to stubborn clogs and cause your pipes to start backing up. Eventually, these backed-up pipes will become burst pipes, which should be avoided at all costs as they are classified as plumbing emergencies and can cause a significant amount of damage in no time at all.</p>
