<p>A clog in your plumbing often affects a single sink, tub, shower or toilet, but if more than one fixture is backed up, you may need to clean out the main drain line. The rectangular space-saving shape also makes it easy for contractors to install up to three pumps in the pit. Take the time to have your sewer line scoped by the professionals at Jim Dandy Sewer and Plumbing. In this approach, a solution is allowed to pass across a filter containing two outlets; one for the filtered water and the other one for the impure water.</p>
