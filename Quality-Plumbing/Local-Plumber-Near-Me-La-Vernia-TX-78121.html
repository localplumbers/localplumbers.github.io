Water softening can prevent these negative effects.</p>
<p>The majority of systems only are able to recover about 5% to 15% of the water that's filtered. Safety is our priority—we obey all environmental laws and regulations to ensure that septic tank waste is responsibly processed and poses no environmental hazards.
