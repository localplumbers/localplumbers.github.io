Regular sump pump maintenance is an important part of keeping your basement or crawlspace dry. A septic tank is a wastewater disposal system that essentially uses bacteria to break down solid waste, allowing liquids to then drain off efficiently. The sump then pumps the water up and out of the basement through a pipe leading to the home's sewer or drain field.</p>
