We handle commercial installations, should you need plumbing in a brand new building or require an entirely new plumbing system in an existing commercial building. Remove the handle, the plastic cover and the screw, and in that order only.</p>
<p>The tank must retain at least two days (48 hours) of sewage flow from the house; size is based on the number of bedrooms in the dwelling.

The clean water is separated from the salt water through this semi permeable membrane that does not allow the salt and contaminants through.
