In practice, the feed water may go through any one or a combination of several of the following pretreatments: sand bed, chlorinator and retention tank, anthracite filter, activated charcoal filter, degasifier, microfilter, neutralizer, and deionizer, depending on the condition of the feed water and the desired quality of the product water.</p>

Unlike in the direct osmosis, where the difference in concentration brings about the force that draws water across the semi-permeable membrane, a pump is used to generate pressure in the Reversed Osmosis.
