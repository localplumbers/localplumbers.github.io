<p>We have spent years working on a variety of water heaters, making us highly qualified in the repair or replacement of all water heater brands and models. If you have an electric water heater, the problem of having no hot water is usually caused by the heating element which should be replaced. However, there is a leak at the cold water connection, a constant 'dribble' in the bowl and a louder sound of water when I actually sit on the 'throne', all of which screams of rusted parts.</p>
<p>When the hardness ions come in contact with the resin beads the hardness ions are collected and the sodium ions are released, thereby softening the water via ion exchange. It's easy to ignore that little drip from the sink, but the EPA reports that a leaky faucet that drips one drop per second wastes about 3,000 gallons of water a year. If a sink is properly taken care of, it can last for years and may only need replacement once a kitchen is renovated.</p>
<p>One common indicator is if water puddles at the top of the sink whenever someone turns on the faucet.
