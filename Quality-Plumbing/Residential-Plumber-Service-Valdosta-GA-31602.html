<p>We are experts in toilet maintenance, repair and replacement. This will mean that it is time to replace your water heater. Whether because of accidents, or because people don't exercise enough care, sinks become clogged on a very regular basis, and sometimes they become so clogged that a sink replacement is necessary.

Our licensed and insured plumbers can address any problem that occurs in a commercial environment as long as it connects to the pipes.</p>
<p>Cal's Plumbing provides fast and reliable drain and sewer installation. That's because drains are built and installed to carry human waste and water, and not a lot else.

We have used Michael several times for different issues and they always provide an awesome service and even wear shoe booties.

Some pipe cleaning methods may damage the interior of pipes, but Hydro Jetting uses a strong stream of water that propels the unit, leaving pipes undamaged. The water flows back up the pipes and comes out at the lowest point, which is usually the bathtub or the shower, because it cannot go down the sewer drains.</p>
<p>When you have a clogged drain, you'd assume that a handy drain cleaner will solve the problem, but that may not the case. The new disposal unit has a connection for the dishwasher, but there is a seal inside that connection.
