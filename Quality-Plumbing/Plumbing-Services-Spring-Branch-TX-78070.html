<p>Installing a water heater is a common home repair job. If you don't know how old your heater is, your local plumber will be able to find out by reading the serial number on the tank. Sometimes water backs up from clogged kitchen sinks. Cross flow filtration cleans the contaminant build up so that the membrane surface remains clean.

<p>When a single drain pipe in your home is clogged, you'll notice that the sink is backing up, the toilet won't flush, or the shower basin is starting to flood. The brine tank is basically a storage tank for sodium chloride (NaCl) or potassium chloride (KCL) which is mixed with water during the brine refill and regeneration cycles.

<p>Create a happier, healthier home today by getting your drains serviced. Our emergency services ensure that we can handle your gas leak at any time of the day. Maintenance of water softeners largely is confined to restocking the salt supply for the brine solution. Many of today's low-flow toilets use 1.28 gallons per flush or even less.
