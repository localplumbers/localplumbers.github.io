If your leaky faucet is a very new faucet or a high-end fixture, you and your plumber can discuss the benefits of repair versus replacement to ensure you get the best value for the money spent.</p>
<p>Leaky faucets are a common household annoyance, but they're often low on the list of a homeowner's concerns.
