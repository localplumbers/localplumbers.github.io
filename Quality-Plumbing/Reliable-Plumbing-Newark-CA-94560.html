<p>Natural gas has a particular smell to it that can warn you if there is a leak occurring in or around your home. Vent piping is coupled with the drain and waste to exhaust sewer gases (normally out the roof) and to allow pressure equalization so drains can drain. The more mineral content, such as magnesium, calcium and a variety of other, the harder your water will be. This can be hard on your plumbing as it can cause build up and corrosion of piping.</p>
<p>Businesses need to provide toilets and sinks for both their clients and their employees and residential systems don't have to support such a demand. Kenmore, in addition to being known for its air filtration and other household appliances, offers a range of water softeners, from the very basic to the heavy-duty models. But to get to the faulty washer, you need to take off the packing nut that is connected to the valve stem.</p>
