<p>The hard water to be treated passes through a bed of the resin which contains sodium and potassium ions. Some types may be fitted with uncovered chrome pipes rather than recessed pipes, making retrofitting these kinds of showers simpler and easier in several applications. Reduced Energy Consumption - Unlike traditional reverse osmosis systems that operate at constant high pressure, Desalitech systems start each batch at a low pressure which is gradually increased during the batch as concentration in the systems builds up. This leads to an average pressure which is lower than the constant pressure of traditional reverse osmosis.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that if you spot a crack in the toilet bowl you won't have to get it replaced as soon. Once the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it must be regenerated (cleaned).
