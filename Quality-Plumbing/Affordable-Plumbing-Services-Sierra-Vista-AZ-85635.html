In practice, the feed water may go through any one or a combination of several of the following pretreatments: sand bed, chlorinator and retention tank, anthracite filter, activated charcoal filter, degasifier, microfilter, neutralizer, and deionizer, depending on the condition of the feed water and the desired quality of the product water.</p>
