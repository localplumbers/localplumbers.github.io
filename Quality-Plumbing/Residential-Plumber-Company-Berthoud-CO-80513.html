Next, water goes through the reverse osmosis membrane where dissolved particles, even too small to be seen with an electron microscope, are removed. 12 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".

If you get your drinking water from a private well, then an RO system is an excellent way to ensure that the water flowing to your tap is safe.
