<p>Our Systems Plan provides coverage for your home's plumbing fixtures and pipes. A float, not unlike one found in a toilet , activates a switch when the water in the pit reaches a certain level. However, if water is backing up in the tub and the sink but no other fixtures in the house, the clog is most likely somewhere on the branch line that attaches to the main line and not the P-traps. If you have a more localized problem, such as a toilet or water heater that is leaking, you can turn off the water supply to these separately.</p>
