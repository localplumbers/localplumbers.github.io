The solid particles eventually go out into the drain field and clogs up the soil, which will be very bad indeed if you do not get professional help.</p>
<p>Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) are the two water hardness-causing minerals. Both models don't cause a slimy or slippery feeling like that of water softened with salt. Finally, the salts used for regeneration get flushed out of the system into sewers or septic systems and can be quite damaging to the environment.
