<p>Cutting out the guesswork - If you have a problem in your pipes that is difficult to detect or diagnose, a sewer video can show us exactly what the problem is so we can accurately diagnose it and get started on the repair. Trust your local, dependable plumbers with all of your sewer line installation, sewer line repair and sewer line inspections needs. There is a possibility of clogging in the drain and only a plumber will be able to get to the root of the problem and repair it.</p>

However, if water is backing up in the tub and the sink but no other fixtures in the house, the clog is most likely somewhere on the branch line that attaches to the main line and not the P-traps. If you have a more localized problem, such as a toilet or water heater that is leaking, you can turn off the water supply to these separately.</p>
