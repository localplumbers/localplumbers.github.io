<p>If there is a problem with a faucet you have purchased and had installed through John Moore, we will repair it anytime within a year of initial installation.

<p>2. Dispose of your cooking oil and grease in the trash: These sticky oils have a way of clinging to our pipes and causing all sorts of blockages as they catch food particles that are passing by.

To diagnose a sewer or drain problem, we rely on video camera inspections to see inside the pipe to make an accurate diagnosis.</p>

A leaky or dripping faucet is generally a sign that a part is worn and needs to be replaced.

They can locate the cause of the low water pressure and repair it. As well, they can repair high risk of damage issues such as water hammer and frozen pipes. The overflow tube is why you don't get a flooded bathroom if something goes wrong with your fill valve, since any excess water in the tank will go down the overflow, into the toilet bowl, and down the drain.</p>

<p>They also come in two pieces: the motor that is installed above the basement floor and the hose that carries the water into the sump pit. This is one plumbing repair that even the most skilled northern California plumbers do not readily attempt. Your septic contractor should also install an effluent filter in the exit baffle of the tank. Watch out for false benefits & claims with electromagnetic and magnetic water softeners.</p>
