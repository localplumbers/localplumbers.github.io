<p>We don't think about them â€¦ until they break, are clogged, start leaking, or won't stop running. If you have any leaks, you can turn the water off and then tighten the plumbing drain parts a little more, or you can leave the water running as you start to tighten the plumbing drain parts, until the water isn't leaking anymore.

Water-powered pumps can only remove 1,500 gallons or less an hour, which makes them costlier than a pedestal or submersible pumps.</p>
