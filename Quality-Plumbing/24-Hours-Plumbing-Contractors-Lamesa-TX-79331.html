<p>To determine the proper septic design for your property our professionals will take a sample of your soil, also known as soil boring, because that is the main factor in the choosing the appropriate septic system.

<p>We don't think about them … until they break, are clogged, start leaking, or won't stop running. If you have any leaks, you can turn the water off and then tighten the plumbing drain parts a little more, or you can leave the water running as you start to tighten the plumbing drain parts, until the water isn't leaking anymore. However, they don't have the same water removal power as submersible or pedestal pumps do. Water-powered pumps can only remove 1,500 gallons or less an hour, which makes them costlier than a pedestal or submersible pumps.</p>
