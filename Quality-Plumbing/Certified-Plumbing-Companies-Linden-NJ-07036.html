You're already about halfway through your sump pump installation. Sewer lines are usually 6 inches or more in diameter so it takes more than just a hairball to clog them. Hard water causes a higher risk of lime scale deposits in household water systems. This just means that ions exchange did not take place and so, there was no hard water softening.</p>
