<p>Installing a water heater is a common home repair job. If you don't know how old your heater is, your local plumber will be able to find out by reading the serial number on the tank. Sometimes water backs up from clogged kitchen sinks. Cross flow filtration cleans the contaminant build up so that the membrane surface remains clean.
