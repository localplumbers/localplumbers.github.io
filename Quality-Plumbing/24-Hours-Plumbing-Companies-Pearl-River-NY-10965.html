<h2>How To Hire Residential Plumbing Companies in Pearl River</h2>
<p>Installing a water heater is a common home repair job. If you don't know how old your heater is, your local plumber will be able to find out by reading the serial number on the tank.

There are substances (like Drano) that are manufactured with the express purpose of clearing drains and toilets. For example, if your kitchen sink is backed up because you flushed potato peels down the disposal, a quick drain snaking can break up the blockage and send it down the pipes.</p>
