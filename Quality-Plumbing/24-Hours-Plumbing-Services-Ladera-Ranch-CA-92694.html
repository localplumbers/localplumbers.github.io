The resin is cleared by flushing a strong sodium (salt) solution held in the brine tank. Heat Pump Water Heaters Heat pump water heaters will significantly increase energy efficiency. The regeneration water is a solution of sodium chloride (common kitchen salt); it flows through the resins and is carried to drain with addiction of calcium and magnesium released from resins.</p>
