For this reason, we recommend that you choose an ion-exchange water softener - one that uses salt to remove the hardness. The definition of Reverse Osmosis, also known as RO, is "the production of pure liquids: a process of purifying water or other liquids such as fruit juices by passing them through a semipermeable membrane that filters out unwanted substances".</p>
<p>It's especially worrying if the clogs are first happening in the drains in the lower levels of the house, then expanding upward. Faucet leaks are commonly found in the cartridge. The semipermeable RO membrane in your RO system is designed to allow water through, but filter out almost all additional contaminants.
