<p>Natural gas has a particular smell to it that can warn you if there is a leak occurring in or around your home. Vent piping is coupled with the drain and waste to exhaust sewer gases (normally out the roof) and to allow pressure equalization so drains can drain. The more mineral content, such as magnesium, calcium and a variety of other, the harder your water will be. This can be hard on your plumbing as it can cause build up and corrosion of piping.</p>

<p>A small electric spark that ignites the gas usually starts the units, little cause for alarm. Expect to be charged $300 to $500 for control valve replacement. The most popular brands of water heaters are reliable, affordable, have good value and are always available. The roots are attracted to the warmth and moisture of the sewer lines and send feelers through tiny cracks or loose joints. This gives the feeling of softer water on the skin, even if the chemical composition is not changed.</p>
