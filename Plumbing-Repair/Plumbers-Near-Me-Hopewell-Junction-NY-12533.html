<p>Maintenance Tip #1 - Preparing the water heater. Water Softeners Are Cation Exchange Devices. For professional garbage disposal installation, give Mr. Rooter a call at (855) 982-2028. If you notice that the water backs up or comes up into the tub or shower when flushing your toilet, then it is a sign that your sewer drain is clogged.

<p>If a clogged storm drain is not addressed in a timely manner, the chances are high that it will cause additional damage to the storm pipe, which will require repair. Sewer drain lines that are fed by hundreds of laterals from individual rooms are much more likely to become blocked by waste, grease and other obstructions. GE water softeners save on salt, water, and energy by using up to 50% less detergent for laundry and dishwashing, using up to 34% less salt and up to 35% less water during regeneration.</p>
