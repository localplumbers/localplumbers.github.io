Our plumbers are trained weekly on the latest plumbing technology. Look underneath your sink for the pipes that run up. Along those pipes somewhere will be handles that you can turn to shut off the water to your sink. The wastewater carried away by your sewer and drain lines is never meant to be allowed to just seep into the ground.</p>
<p>These are commonly used in kitchen sinks and usually include a single handle that moves over a cap that is shaped like a rounded ball right above the base of the spout. We will test the water meter to ensure that it is working properly and that there is no movement when all faucets are shut, as movement would indicate leaks. In addition, if your local area has recently experienced a drought or you simply haven't had to operate your sump pump in a long time, it might not be operational when needed and could need a tune-up.</p>
