<p>Preventative maintenance is even more effective; regular drain cleaning in homes can stop these drains from clogging, breeding bacteria, and eventually flooding homes. However, if your toilet is particularly old or needs more frequent and costly repairs, you might need to consider upgrading to a new one.

If you have a more localized problem, such as a toilet or water heater that is leaking, you can turn off the water supply to these separately.</p>
