<p>These plumbing pipes allow air to enter the system whenever the water is running inside for example the dishwasher or flushing the toilet. A septic tank consists of one or more concrete or plastic tanks of between 4000 and 7500 litres (1,000 and 2,000 gallons); one end is connected to an inlet wastewater pipe and the other to a septic drain field Generally these pipe connections are made with a T pipe, allowing liquid to enter and exit without disturbing any crust on the surface.</p>

<p>Your drain and sewer piping should be smooth and clear so waste water can move through with ease, out to the street, and not back up into your home.

<p>You will need to know what voltage your water heater is. While is seems like common sense to tell you, make sure you turn off the circuit breakers if you will be installing any electrical connections. The activation of a faucet requiring hot water activates the heater and water is heated as it flows through a heating coil or heat exchanger. Another cause for having little hot water could be that the dip tube that usually supplies cold water to the tank is faulty or broken.</p>

Water softening can be used to reduce these symptoms. The inlet valve controls the water supply coming into the tank.
