<p>Leaky faucets are a common household annoyance, but they're often low on the list of a homeowner's concerns.

These cameras can be used to locate the problem, and to oversee cleaning and repair work.</p>
<p>When the hardness ions come in contact with the resin beads the hardness ions are collected and the sodium ions are released, thereby softening the water via ion exchange. It's easy to ignore that little drip from the sink, but the EPA reports that a leaky faucet that drips one drop per second wastes about 3,000 gallons of water a year. If a sink is properly taken care of, it can last for years and may only need replacement once a kitchen is renovated.</p>

<p>Outdoor showers are popular in homes near lakes or beaches as well as homes with pools or hot tubs. Newer toilets are more environmentally friendly, and will cost less in monthly water bills by utilizing less water than other toilets.
