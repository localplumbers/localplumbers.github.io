<p>Remember that drinking from a reverse osmosis water filtering systems causes the same health problems as drinking from a distillation purifier. With daily use, drains frequently become clogged, leading to stoppages and water backups. This can be due to loose water pipes or water in the air chambers.

<p>It's not only a problem that uncertified plumbers are not usually qualified enough to fix big plumbing problems, but they also can be dishonest and charge you a lot for fixes that are not needed, or they do not even do. Thus, you shouldn't just decide on the lowest estimate, but alternatively look for adequate service. Carbon filters, another option, remove chlorine, but need to be changed fairly often.</p>
