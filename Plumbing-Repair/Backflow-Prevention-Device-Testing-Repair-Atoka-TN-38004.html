<p>An RO storage tank holds reverse osmosis water so you have plenty to use when you need it. A reverse osmosis system makes water slowly. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. Two, the 8and quot; of rain from Tropical Storm Lee caused the drain field to flow back into the septic tank causing a backup of the septic tank. The very process that the reverse osmosis faucet depends on strips out these minerals.</p>

A clogged drain is one of the most annoying problems a homeowner has to deal with, and also one of the most frequent plumbing issues.
