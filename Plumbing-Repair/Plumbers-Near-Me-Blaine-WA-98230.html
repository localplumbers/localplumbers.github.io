<p>Reverse osmosis systems work by pushing tap water through a membrane or film that has tiny holes in it. In theory, only pure water molecules can pass through the tiny holes, leaving pollutants, little organisms and minerals on the dirty side of the membrane. We clear debris and fix broken pipes leaving your home that can cause thousands of dollars in property damage. There are three signs you have sediment buildup in your tank: A lower element burnout if you have an electric water heater, A lot of noise if you have a gas water heater, or a foul odor coming from both types of water heaters.</p>
<p>For thread-in-type elements like we show here, you'll need a water heater element wrench ($5 at home centers and hardware stores). Moving a shower involves changing pipes in the wall and under the floor. Turn on the water to fill the toilet tank.
