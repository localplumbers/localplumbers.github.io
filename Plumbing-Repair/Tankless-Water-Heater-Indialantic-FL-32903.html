<p>Thus, a post-filter consisting of carbon is usually employed to take care of this problem as the water travels out of the tank to the faucet. This is located along the discharge tube and it prevents the water from flowing back into the sump pump when it stops or malfunctions. When spotting rusting call your commercial plumber or manufacturer in to apply the appropriate repair. Leaving the drain clearing to the professionals keeps you and your pipes safe.</p>
