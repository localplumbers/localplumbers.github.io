Check several building plumbing fixtures: Refining the above procedure, if the main building drain is clogged, or if the on-site waste disposal system is blocked, fixtures on upper floors in a building may appear to drain normally, while fixtures on lower floors or at the lowest level in the building may not drain at all, or may even overflow back into the building when upper floor fixtures are operated.</p>
