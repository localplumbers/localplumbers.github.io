<p>Copper repipe systems may also be subjected to the challenges of corrosion over a period of time, particular when the system is exposed to hot water and chlorine over long periods. While certain specialty flush valves or flappers might require a specific trip lever to work properly, most toilets will work just fine with a "will fit" lever - which is good news for people who can't find their model number or who maybe have remodeled or upgraded their fixtures and want a different finish or style handle to match the rest of their bathroom décor.</p>

Hardness of water is due to the presence of soluble calcium, magnesium or iron compounds. Many appliances rely on natural gas to function, such as stoves, dishwashers, water heaters , and washers and dryers. Dissolved calcium and magnesium precipitate out of hard water as scale, which builds up on the insides of pipes, water heaters , tea kettles, coffee makers and industrial machinery.</p>
<p>When the hardness ions come in contact with the resin beads the hardness ions are collected and the sodium ions are released, thereby softening the water via ion exchange. It's easy to ignore that little drip from the sink, but the EPA reports that a leaky faucet that drips one drop per second wastes about 3,000 gallons of water a year. If a sink is properly taken care of, it can last for years and may only need replacement once a kitchen is renovated.</p>
