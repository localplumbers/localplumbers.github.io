<p>This means that the cause is somewhere between the water heater and the fixtures. The countercurrent cycle runs the brine up the resin bed, beginning at the bottom where the resin beads are usually the least depleted.

Nothing is inconveniencing as a faulty water heater. The plumbers replace the old gas pipes with new pipes.</p>
