<p>A water softener removes minerals that create water hardness, one of the most common water quality problems a homeowner encounters. You're already about halfway through your sump pump installation. Sewer lines are usually 6 inches or more in diameter so it takes more than just a hairball to clog them. Hard water causes a higher risk of lime scale deposits in household water systems. This just means that ions exchange did not take place and so, there was no hard water softening.</p>

The correct septic tank size depends on the anticipated usage. Liquid drain cleaner sold at your local home improvement big box store can help with a few things, but it's actually pretty limited in its ability to solve problems inside your drains and it can be corrosive and damaging to many types of pipes.</p>
