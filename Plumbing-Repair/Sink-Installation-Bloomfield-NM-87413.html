<p>5 Stage: Some people count the tank as a stage, others will start to add a never growing list of add-on filters that do an ever increasing list of 'amazing things' to the water including re-introducing many of the minerals and such that your filter has just taken out. 2. Electricity Charges: All of our residential Reverse Osmosis systems require no electricity, running only on water pressure. While this is necessary, it leaves you with a shortened drainpipe that you'll need to extend before you can install the new drain.</p>
