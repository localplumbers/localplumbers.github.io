<p>Leaky faucets increase your utility bills: No one wants to pay more than necessary on their water bills. Leaks can usually be fixed with a repair than an entire replacement. When the calcium and magnesium from hard water builds up in your plumbing, your shower-head won't produce a nice spray of water, your water pressure will also drop.
