Needless to say, drain backups can be a sticky and smelly situation — which is why it's important to enlist the help of professional plumbers. Check the sump pump's electrical cords - After locating the sump pump in your basement, crawl space, or mechanical room, unplug its two cords from the electrical outlet.</p>
<p>If you'd like to learn more about our tankless water heaters or other options, please contact our team today. Clogged drains, broken water pipes and leaky septic tanks - everybody knows what a nightmare these things could be.
