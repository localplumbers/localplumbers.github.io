<p>As we all know a plumber is the one who works in lead, copper, fits, repairs pipes for the transportation of water, gas or drainage. Most RO units with a cellulose acetate membrane are designed to operate between 55 F - 86 F. (13 C - 30 C). In practice, the feed water may go through any one or a combination of several of the following pretreatments: sand bed, chlorinator and retention tank, anthracite filter, activated charcoal filter, degasifier, microfilter, neutralizer, and deionizer, depending on the condition of the feed water and the desired quality of the product water.</p>
<p>Copper repipe systems may also be subjected to the challenges of corrosion over a period of time, particular when the system is exposed to hot water and chlorine over long periods.
