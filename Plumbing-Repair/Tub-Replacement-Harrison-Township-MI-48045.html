<p>Water heaters are a necessity in homes and businesses so manufacturers have made sure to continually update them as new technology is available. If you need any type of natural gas installation, whether for a new gas fireplace installation, gas stove installation or gas furnace installation, the gas line specialists at Any Hour Services can help.

With over 85% of the United States relying on hard water for their cooking, cleaning, and bathing, water softeners serve a vital purpose.</p>
<p>Compression units are the old-style two-handle (one valve for hot water, one for cold) still common in bathroom and laundry room sinks. In addition to blockages caused by these materials, main sewer pipes can get blocked in other ways, for example, tree roots growing into the pipe joints and soil blocking the pipe when it is broken by vehicle traffic. If the toilet cannot be repaired, or if the repair cost approaches replacement cost, we'll discuss your options.</p>

Clogged drains, broken water pipes and leaky septic tanks - everybody knows what a nightmare these things could be. This is why video drain inspection is one of the top things on the list of home maintenance.
