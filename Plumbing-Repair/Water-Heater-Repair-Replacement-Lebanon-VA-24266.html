Dump solvents, oils, paint thinners, disinfectants, pesticides or poisons down the drain as they can disrupt the treatment process and contaminate the groundwater.

<p>There are many different factors that can affect the actual cost of having a septic tank installed - including tank size and material, permitting requirements, soil makeup and installation charges, which can all affect the cost of a septic system.
