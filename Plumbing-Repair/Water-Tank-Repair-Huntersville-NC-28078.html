<p>The system will remove less of all of the contaminants or only one of the contaminants will be removed and the remaining contaminants will pass through the membrane. Fresh water may be either ‘hard' or ‘soft'. If these outlets become obstructed, they can cause gas leaks. Roto-Rooter's professional plumbers can clean downspouts, locate clogs in outdoor plumbing.
