Things we will look at include; the potential septic tank site, access to the site, and consider the grade of the site, distance from the dwelling, if there is a history of instability on the site, and where the disposal area will be. Then we consider the soakage area and what vegetation and plants would be best with any particular soakage design, or if the treatment area needs to be fenced (to be protected from stock for example), and specific council guidelines for your area.</p>
