<p>They will take up residence inside the rim of a toilet bowl (as well as the sink and tub traps and overflows) and whenever the toilet is flushed or water run in the sink, the fresh water rushing around the toilet rim will stir up the sewer gas and push it out into the bowl. Toilets have the most direct route to the sewer, as well as the biggest drain line. At Panda, Softening systems are designed to remove every trace of calcium and magnesium ions which cause the hardness in water.</p>
