<p>Many different projects around the house have been easily placed into the do-it-yourself category. Trying to extend the pipe while you're working overhead in a tight space is both time-consuming and physically challenging, so it's often quicker (and simpler) just to cut out the entire drain trap and replace it.

<p>Empty the water from the trap into a bucket, then make sure the trap isn't clogged. Once water is drawn from the RO faucet, the pressure in the tank drops; the shut off valve then opens to send the drinking water through the membrane while the contaminated wastewater is diverted down the drain. Carbon block filters tend to last longer and they do not experience any leakage.
