Perhaps you too have been thinking about installing a water softener. A piece will be needed to connect your drain directly to the garbage disposal or wall trap. As one of the most highly used plumbing fixtures in your home, the kitchen sink is vital to a smoothly operating kitchenâ€”and household.</p>
<p>These softeners are well worth the investment as they will work hard to make your water the best possible for you. For full water leak detection service, call Top Service Plumbing. Before you start the bathroom modernization project, you need to check the condition of the old plumbing.
