<p>The method and apparatus of the invention is an innovative technology for water softening treatment that does not generate a brine waste stream nor does it release harmful ions into the water. Household water is directed through a pre-filter where lead, chlorine taste and odor and sediment are reduced.

<p>It's not only a problem that uncertified plumbers are not usually qualified enough to fix big plumbing problems, but they also can be dishonest and charge you a lot for fixes that are not needed, or they do not even do. Thus, you shouldn't just decide on the lowest estimate, but alternatively look for adequate service. Carbon filters, another option, remove chlorine, but need to be changed fairly often.</p>
