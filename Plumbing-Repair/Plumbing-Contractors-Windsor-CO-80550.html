<p>We have spent years working on a variety of water heaters, making us highly qualified in the repair or replacement of all water heater brands and models. If you have an electric water heater, the problem of having no hot water is usually caused by the heating element which should be replaced.

For greater amounts of water the optional tank systems (200l, 600l or 1000l) are a comfortable solution.</p>
<p>Water can be naturally soft (water supplies derived from lakes and streams are often naturally soft); or it can be soft due to artificial treatment, either at the municipal water utility company, or by means of an in-house water treatment appliance known as a water softener.

<p>Our plumbers arrive fully-equipped to inspect and repair all common disasters, including burst pipes, severe clogs, backups, flooding, and more. If you have an instant water heater, examine the consumer unit power.
