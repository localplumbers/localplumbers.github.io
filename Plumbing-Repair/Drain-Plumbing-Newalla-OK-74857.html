When drain lines are working well, the water flows quickly, straight down the drain. If the old and inefficient water heater is leaking and needs replaced, it is a good time to talk to the professionals and see if tankless hot water heaters are right for you.

Some of them have the anode installed in a separate opening on top of the tank and some use a combination anode rod that is installed in the hot water outlet of the tank.</p>
