<p>Since I already have this system in my home, I decided to first look at reverse osmosis systems and see what I actually have under my sink. When you flush the toilet, pressurized water is forced into the bowl, blasting waste down the drainpipe. Evaporated water softener salt is going to be a bit more expensive than the other choices because of the solubility.
