Another popular type of filter are counter-top water filters, which hook directly to the faucet after the aerator is removed.</p>
<p>However, water heaters can be susceptible to damage especially when the unit is already past its lifespan or not receiving any maintenance. Pry off the decorative cap if necessary (usually reading Hot” or Cold”), unscrew, and remove the handle. Depending on the severity of the drain blockage, there are different approaches that you can take to clear a clogged or slow flowing drain.
