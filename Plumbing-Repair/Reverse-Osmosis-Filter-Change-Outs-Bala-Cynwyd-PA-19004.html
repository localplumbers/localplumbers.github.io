While not a pleasant experience, a hand auger can reach between 2 to 5 feet down the toilet's drain pipe to break-up or retrieve things (such as Junior's action figure) that are blocking the pipe.

It allows the plumber to accurately identify possible problems within the plumbing system which can save time and money by isolating the repair rather than going through a troubleshooting process. Nothing is inconveniencing as a faulty water heater. The plumbers replace the old gas pipes with new pipes.</p>
