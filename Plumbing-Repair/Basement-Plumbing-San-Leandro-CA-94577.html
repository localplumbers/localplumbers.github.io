<p>Sometimes, we imagine doing things very easy. Our experienced craftsmen bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to every job, and they'll be happy to assist in installing your chosen sink in your kitchen or bathroom.

Call Canyon Hills Plumbing at (951) 970-7550 if you need a sewer video inspection.</p>
<p>Next look under each sink with a flash light while the water is running and make sure there are no leaks at supply lines and drain. In heavily trafficked areas, shifts in the ground or the weight of the soil can offset drain lines and cause misalignment around pipe joints, break seals between pipes, or cause sewer lines to collapse in on themselves. The hardness of water is usually measured as ppm (part per million) of calcium carbonate; it is also used the French degree (°Fr), where 1 °Fr = 10 ppm of calcium carbonate.</p>
<p>Prior to any drain cleaning services, we will perform a camera inspection. But it's important for you, the homeowner, to know what a sewer camera inspection can find and what it can't.
