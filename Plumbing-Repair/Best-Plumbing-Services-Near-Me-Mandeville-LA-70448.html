<p>Because enzymatic cleaners rely on liquid flowing through the pipe to disperse, they are also generally not intended to open completely clogged drains. High water levels should trigger your sump pump to begin working to redirect incoming water. Instead, they stay in suspension and are flushed out to the drain field, where they plug up the pores of the soil bed.

When you wake up on a cold winter morning and find your pipes frozen, have the number handy for the licensed plumbers at Blue Planet Plumbing.

<p>These are commonly used in kitchen sinks and usually include a single handle that moves over a cap that is shaped like a rounded ball right above the base of the spout. We will test the water meter to ensure that it is working properly and that there is no movement when all faucets are shut, as movement would indicate leaks.
