<p>Purchase a 15 year heating unit and you will pay more to get a unit built to last 10 years and a manufacturer crossing their fingers. The vent system—part of the plumbing that is usually less well known to most homeowners—is connected to the drain-waste piping, and its job is to ventilate sewage gases so they don't build up in the house. The filtered water is then stored in the tank until it is used. The control valve serves as the traffic cop in your water softener system.</p>
