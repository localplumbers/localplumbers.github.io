<p>A sump pump is a piece of equipment that plays a huge role in keeping flood- and leak-prone basements dry. You'll understand why you need a plumber's help when you go to lift a fifty-pound toilet off of the base to replace the wax ring, and then try to set it back down on the bolts without being able to see the bolts or the wax ring.
