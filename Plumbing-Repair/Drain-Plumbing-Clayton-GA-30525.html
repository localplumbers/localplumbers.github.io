Bathroom Plumbing the DIY way usually involves minor repairs such as replacing a faulty washer, changing the flapper in the toilet tank or the trap that is below your sink, etc. Salt-based ion-exchange water softeners are the main form of water softener used for domestic household water supplies.</p>

<p>If your septic system becomes clogged and you frequently have to clean the filter, you might be tempted to simply remove it. Keep it. Septic tanks work by allowing waste to separate into three layers: solids, effluent and scum (see illustration above).

The plumber should be observant and vigilant enough to detect any gas leaks inside the household. Decaying food causes unpleasant smells, which can linger long after the waste has been removed.
