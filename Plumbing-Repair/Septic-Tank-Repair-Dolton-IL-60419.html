<p>Rural people filter river or ocean water themselves, as the device is easy to use (saline water may need special membranes). The drain-waste-vent system collects waste water from fixtures and waste from toilets and delivers them to the sewer or septic system. Tankless water heaters last 15 to 20 years. The company delivers soft water exchange tanks to the customer on a schedule determined by household size and water hardness level.</p>
<p>Unlike other methods, the method of the invention does not replace removed ions with sodium ions. The resin beads chemically attract the unwanted ‘hard' mineral ions and exchange them with sodium ions. The WSP automatically completes a regeneration cycle whereby the filter is backwashed and the resin recharged with sodium ions via the brine regeneration tank. Next, remove the loose knockout plug from inside the garbage disposal.</p>
