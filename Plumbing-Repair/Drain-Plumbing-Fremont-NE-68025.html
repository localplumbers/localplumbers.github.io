<p>Commercial plumbing services offered by plumbers are vital to business and industry. The troubled voice is a common one, and the prepackaged mantras of the Flat Rate Company - "Honey, just call ________." (Fill in the blank with a name of Flat Rate Company.); "Repairs and maintenance on all systems"; "You get firm, up-front estimates and fair, competitive prices"; "Better quality guarantee"; "90 days no payments, no interest financing"; "At last, a serviceman who is always on time, or you don't pay a dime"; "Never an overtime charge"; "You know the price, before we start"; "Clean, professional technicians"; "Immediate response"; "Our prices are based on established standards"; "_______ solves over thousands of residential problems a year and we can solve yours now" - are like valium to ease the caller's anxiety.</p>
