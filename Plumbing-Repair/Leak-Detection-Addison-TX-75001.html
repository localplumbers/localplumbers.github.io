<p>The cost for a 1,000-gallon septic tank to support up to 3-bedrooms is between $2,190 and $5,200 with most homeowners spending $3,250 on average.

<p>Compression units are the old-style two-handle (one valve for hot water, one for cold) still common in bathroom and laundry room sinks. In addition to blockages caused by these materials, main sewer pipes can get blocked in other ways, for example, tree roots growing into the pipe joints and soil blocking the pipe when it is broken by vehicle traffic. If the toilet cannot be repaired, or if the repair cost approaches replacement cost, we'll discuss your options.</p>
<p>Most times, it's just a small amount of water leaking out, but it can be annoying, and should be fixed.
