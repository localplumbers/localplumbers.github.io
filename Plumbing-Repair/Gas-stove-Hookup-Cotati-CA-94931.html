<p>So in 2 or 3 minutes, you are ready to go. To get the fuel back into the tank after the repair - reverse the pump direction. This is where the water has to pass through the reverse osmosis membrane. French drains (pipes with holes in them) are attached to the tank and the clean inert fluid is discharged over a large surface area and absorbed by the soil. Firstly, it starts to push the dirty water as well as the waste out of the bowl and into the pipe thereby leading to the sewer or also known as the septic tank.</p>

<p>The water valves are turned off in order to cut off the supply of water to the sink when the repair work is ongoing. While not a pleasant experience, a hand auger can reach between 2 to 5 feet down the toilet's drain pipe to break-up or retrieve things (such as Junior's action figure) that are blocking the pipe.
