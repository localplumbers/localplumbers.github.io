If you only find a softener to expensive for your current budget or your needs and simply want to be able to more effectively wash your dishes and clothing that you should probably opt for a Calgon water softener because instead of a system they mainly provide a softening detergent that you can mix with your usual cleaning products while making it much more difficult for the "hard metals" to prevent your usual detergents to do their cleaning.</p>

<p>Before contacting your gas supplier, get details on the following to see if you qualify for a free or low-cost installation.
