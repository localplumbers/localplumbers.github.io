If after weighing the advantages and disadvantages of water softening, you decide to soften your water, the next question you must consider is "How much?" Have the water tested by an independent lab and determine its classification from Table 1. Although many water softening companies offer free hardness testing, its best to have a third party evaluation.</p>
