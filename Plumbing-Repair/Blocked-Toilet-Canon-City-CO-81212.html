<p>Sewer leaks and drain backups can be caused by pipes that are physically damaged—broken, collapsed, or cracks. Preventative Maintenance Inspection: We provide this service free with any repair or plumbing service. This is one of the most important parts to buying a sump pump system because a good maintenance or service program will check and clean out your sump pump and its parts every year. The cause is often tree roots growing into the sewer pipe or an aging pipe that is disintegrating underground (in both cases, sewage will usually pool on the ground's surface near the problem).</p>
<p>Mound systems are an option in areas of shallow soil depth, high groundwater, or shallow bedrock. Leaves aren't the only culprit, however - roots from trees are notorious for growing underneath in search of water and as a result, will usually head straight to your drains. Bellied Sewer Lines - Repeat blockages occur when a part of your sewer pipe starts to sag.Sometimes this is caused by soil erosion under the pipe, foundation settlement, or poor soil compaction.</p>
