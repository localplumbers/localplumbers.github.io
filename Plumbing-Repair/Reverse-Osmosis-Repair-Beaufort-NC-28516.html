<p>A typical reverse osmosis system is shown in the flow diagram (Figure 5) (image size 11KB) Feed water is passed through a prefilter after pH adjustment, and is pumped to the membrane modules at the designed pressure. Toilets built before 1994 use an average of 3-5 gallons per flush, where today's high-efficiency models use8 to 1.6 gallons to efficiently clear away waste. If after weighing the advantages and disadvantages of water softening, you decide to soften your water, the next question you must consider is "How much?" Have the water tested by an independent lab and determine its classification from Table 1. Although many water softening companies offer free hardness testing, its best to have a third party evaluation.</p>
