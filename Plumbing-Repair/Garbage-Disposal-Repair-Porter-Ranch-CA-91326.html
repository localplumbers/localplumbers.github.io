The water will also go through remineralization at 2 points, before the storage tank and before it travels to the faucet, where a small amount of healthy minerals are added to increase its alkalinity and give back the natural sweetness to the water. Usually, there is a partial rubber closure, known as a splashguard, on the top of the disposal unit to prevent food waste from flying back up out of the grinding chamber.</p>

This way when waste water enters the pipe, it will fill the pipe to the height of the holes and overflow from ALL of the holes using the entire leach field.
