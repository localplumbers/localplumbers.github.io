It pays to learn how to toilet works so you can do simple repairs yourself and save money when there is a problem. In this tank, cold water is used to fill the tank, and an element, usually near the top & bottom inside the tank is used to heat it.

Once you have an idea of the hardness of your water, calculate your household usage in gallons. A running toilet can use up a large amount of water over a fairly short period, so it is important to get it fixed as soon as possible. That doesn't necessarily mean you will see mold growth that soon, but the IAQ could be compromised by mold or bacterial activity, so can the cleanliness of the water.</p>
<p>However, using a reverse osmosis system to treat hard water (above 7 grains) shortens the life of the RO membrane.
