Vent piping is coupled with the drain and waste to exhaust sewer gases (normally out the roof) and to allow pressure equalization so drains can drain. The more mineral content, such as magnesium, calcium and a variety of other, the harder your water will be. This can be hard on your plumbing as it can cause build up and corrosion of piping.</p>

<p>In the Salt-Free Water Softeners article, you'll also find a discussion of a more controversial option—the electronic or magnetic water softener or descaler. If a drain clog is especially difficult, including built-up grease, grit and debris that won't respond to a drain snake auger, then high-pressure water jetting may be in order. The tungsten compound would then be reused to recharge the water-softening columns.</p>
<p>Trying to wash the sediment out of the drain valve on the outside of the water heater is also impossible. Some only run an inspection of the pipes during negotiations or prior to purchasing the property. A pump is required to bring effluent up to the drain field. Vic City Plumbing are expert plumbers, offering professional residential and commercial plumbing services.
