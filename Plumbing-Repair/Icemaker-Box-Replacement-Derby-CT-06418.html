While nearly everyone loves the taste from this water filtration system, a few people tested the pH and complained that it wasn't as alkaline as they hoped for in a system that adds back beneficial minerals.

<p>An obvious sign of a sewer drain clog is when more than one plumbing fixture backs up at the same time. Step 2: Disconnect the drain arm and dishwasher tube from the old unit. If all the major plumbing in your home was done cleanly and conscientiously, disconnecting your old water heater and replacing it with a new one is a cakewalk, even if you don't religiously watch "This Old House." The only items you'll need are a spray bottle with soapy water, an adjustable wrench, a screwdriver, and a garden hose.</p>

While not a pleasant experience, a hand auger can reach between 2 to 5 feet down the toilet's drain pipe to break-up or retrieve things (such as Junior's action figure) that are blocking the pipe. Another factor that contributes to the cost of the repair is the decision whether the gas line should be extended or should be replaced as a whole.</p>
