<p>If a clogged storm drain is not addressed in a timely manner, the chances are high that it will cause additional damage to the storm pipe, which will require repair. Sewer drain lines that are fed by hundreds of laterals from individual rooms are much more likely to become blocked by waste, grease and other obstructions. GE water softeners save on salt, water, and energy by using up to 50% less detergent for laundry and dishwashing, using up to 34% less salt and up to 35% less water during regeneration.</p>

If you have a faucet that just won't stop dripping or you suspect that there is a more serious leak in your kitchen, it's time to contact the experts at Beacon Hill Plumbing.

The ball valve uses a single handle that controls a specially designed ball inside the faucet body. We'd like to help guide you toward the right service for your pipes. There are some models that do not use salt, such as the Pelican NaturSoft series, and you should also go for a one that does not waste water through backwashing.</p>
<p>They will take up residence inside the rim of a toilet bowl (as well as the sink and tub traps and overflows) and whenever the toilet is flushed or water run in the sink, the fresh water rushing around the toilet rim will stir up the sewer gas and push it out into the bowl. Toilets have the most direct route to the sewer, as well as the biggest drain line. At Panda, Softening systems are designed to remove every trace of calcium and magnesium ions which cause the hardness in water.</p>

After cycling through numerous plumbers - both professional and handyman - over the years, I will definitely use TLC again for plumbing at this old adobe house. Tightening the handle compresses the washer against a "seat" and seals the opening, thus stopping the water flow. Gary and his team did an excellent job repairing my rather serious plumbing issue.</p>
<p>If you need assistance with your water heater, give us a call, and we'll provide a thorough explanation of how to fix the problem. The frequency of cleaning depends on the amount and purity of the salt used in the softening process. Commercial Drain Cleaners: Commercial drain cleaners will corrode metal drainpipes.

<p>This is important information because if left untreated your tank may leak water into your home, causing a massive headache and extensive damage, and may also stop producing hot water at all, leaving you and your family without access to hot water.
