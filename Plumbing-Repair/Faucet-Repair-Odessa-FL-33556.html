Water softening can prevent these negative effects.</p>
<p>Additionally, dependable battery backup sump pumps can also turn on if your sump pump becomes overwhelmed by heavy rains or flooding, potentially giving your basement waterproofing system the extra kick it needs to keep a dry basement. If your water heater is producing some hot water but not enough to meet your needs, there are several possible issues to address , including the temperature setting, the heating elements (electric heaters only), sediment in the tank, and a damaged or disconnected dip tube.</p>
