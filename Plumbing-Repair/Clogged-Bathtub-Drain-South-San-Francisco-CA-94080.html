If you have an electric water heater, the problem of having no hot water is usually caused by the heating element which should be replaced. However, there is a leak at the cold water connection, a constant 'dribble' in the bowl and a louder sound of water when I actually sit on the 'throne', all of which screams of rusted parts.</p>
<p>5 Stage: Some people count the tank as a stage, others will start to add a never growing list of add-on filters that do an ever increasing list of 'amazing things' to the water including re-introducing many of the minerals and such that your filter has just taken out. 2.
