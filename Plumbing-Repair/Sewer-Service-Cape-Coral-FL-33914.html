<p>Installing a water heater is a common home repair job. If you don't know how old your heater is, your local plumber will be able to find out by reading the serial number on the tank. Sometimes water backs up from clogged kitchen sinks. Cross flow filtration cleans the contaminant build up so that the membrane surface remains clean. There are substances (like Drano) that are manufactured with the express purpose of clearing drains and toilets. For example, if your kitchen sink is backed up because you flushed potato peels down the disposal, a quick drain snaking can break up the blockage and send it down the pipes.</p>

It's easy to ignore that little drip from the sink, but the EPA reports that a leaky faucet that drips one drop per second wastes about 3,000 gallons of water a year. If a sink is properly taken care of, it can last for years and may only need replacement once a kitchen is renovated.</p>
