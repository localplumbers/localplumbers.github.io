<p>The popup stopper in many bathroom sinks and tubs can also build up this "gunk". To look for trapped air running water in the sink that is closest to the toilet is a good idea. Installed under the kitchen sink, a garbage disposal uses sharp blades and a motor to grind (and practically liquefy) food waste so it can flow down through the drains and into the sewage system. The rub comes because the trap also traps some of the hair and soap scum we send through it. Over time, this tends to build up until, busy little beaver that it is, it dams up the drain.</p>
