<p>In the Salt-Free Water Softeners article, you'll also find a discussion of a more controversial option—the electronic or magnetic water softener or descaler. If a drain clog is especially difficult, including built-up grease, grit and debris that won't respond to a drain snake auger, then high-pressure water jetting may be in order.
