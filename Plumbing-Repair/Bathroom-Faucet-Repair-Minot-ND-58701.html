Also called a garbage disposer, a garbage disposal comes in two basic types - continuous feed, which usually has a wall-mounted switch so the unit keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which requires a food cover be in place to operate the unit.</p>
<p>Additionally, it costs about $700 for an installed tank water heater but two to three times that amount for a tankless system. Nobody wants to have a drain in their house that clogs up or drains so slowly that it's leaving a few inches of water at the bottom of the shower.

<p>A sewer that is root-infested or broken, or flat, can contribute to a major clog that backs up into a home or business establishment resulting in thousands of dollars in damage, repairs, and loss in property value. Putting a septic system in requires knowing about water tables, topsoil and requirements for space allowances between the house and the septic bed. All waste water tries to get to the main sewer line and so all drain pipes flow that way.</p>
