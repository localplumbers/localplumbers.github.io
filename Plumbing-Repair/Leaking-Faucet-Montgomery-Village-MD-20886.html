<p>A sump pump is typically installed at the lowest point of a basement. While it's a useful as a secondary tool in a leak location test, a sewer camera by itself cannot be used to to determine if you have a leak or to find a leak. A reverse osmosis system removes sediment and chlorine from water with a prefilter before it forces water through a semipermeable membrane to remove dissolved solids. The camera travels through the pipe while transmitting video back to the technician in real-time.</p>
