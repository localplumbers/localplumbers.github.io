If you have a main sewer line clog, water will back up and start to overflow into different plumbing fixtures.</p>
<p>1. Modifying any plumbing sanitary sewer lines that are not exposed (i.e. inside walls, ceilings, attics, foundations, and yards) will require a permit.

Many a times in order to add elegance to a bathroom, bronze is added on the faucets. If that simple order or sequence gets mixed up, it's time to call a plumber to fix a monumental plumbing disaster.</p>
<p>Emergencies involving gas line leaks or gas tank repair ALWAYS require professional plumbers and a plumbing permit. MOST HOMEOWNERS ARE NOT AWARE that the main sewer line can become clogged over the years. There will be no need to worry about a clogged drain because we will restore your line to working order. The solids stay in the tank while the wastewater is discharged to the drainfield for further treatment and dispersal.</p>
