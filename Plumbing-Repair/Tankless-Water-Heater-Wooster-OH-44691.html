<p>Reverse osmosis is a process that finds application in the purification of water. This Biomat will act like a liner in the bottom of the trench, and will prevent the wastewater from percolating into the soil below.

<p>Ordinary tap water can contain excessive chlorine, chloramines, copper, nitrates, nitrites, phosphates, silicates, or many other chemicals detrimental to the sensitive organisms in a reef environment. Reverse osmosis water drained from your home is already free of chemicals since they've been removed in the carbon filtration stage. Without going into a full blown garbage disposal review, a good plan is to choose a model with the highest horsepower rating your budget allows.</p>
