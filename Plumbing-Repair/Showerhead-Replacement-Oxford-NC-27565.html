<p>If a clogged storm drain is not addressed in a timely manner, the chances are high that it will cause additional damage to the storm pipe, which will require repair. Sewer drain lines that are fed by hundreds of laterals from individual rooms are much more likely to become blocked by waste, grease and other obstructions.
