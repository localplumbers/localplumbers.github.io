<p>Our services for commercial properties include installations, upfits, upgrades, repairs, and any other commercial plumbing situations you are facing. The clean water is sent along to the point of use and the contaminants are discharged to a drain. This way when waste water enters the pipe, it will fill the pipe to the height of the holes and overflow from ALL of the holes using the entire leach field. The more expensive ones often boast more stages (which refers to the number of filters used), the ability to filter larger quantities of water at a time, and extra features like autoflush.</p>
