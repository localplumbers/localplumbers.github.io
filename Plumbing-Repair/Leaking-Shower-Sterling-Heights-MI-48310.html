For example, the standard directions for toilet tank flush valve replacement include, Be careful of permanently scratching the flush valve seat”, shut off main valve”, disconnect hoses”, and be careful not to crack the toilet tank.” Even if you make it this far, the only thing you can do if your new tank flush valve doesn't work is check for leaks” and make adjustments.” Suddenly, a fifty-minute project turns into an indefinitely unresolved issue.</p>

Your toilet is most likely leaking if you hear running water for an extended period of time after flushing.</p>
<p>They will take up residence inside the rim of a toilet bowl (as well as the sink and tub traps and overflows) and whenever the toilet is flushed or water run in the sink, the fresh water rushing around the toilet rim will stir up the sewer gas and push it out into the bowl. Toilets have the most direct route to the sewer, as well as the biggest drain line.
