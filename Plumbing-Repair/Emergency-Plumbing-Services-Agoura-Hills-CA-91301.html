<p>As a homeowner, you might be concerned about the cost of installing or replacing your water heater. When water enters into your basement, a sump pump is responsible for transferring it out of your home. If a plumber unknowingly strikes a gas line while cutting through a sewer blockage, natural gas could enter the sewer system.
