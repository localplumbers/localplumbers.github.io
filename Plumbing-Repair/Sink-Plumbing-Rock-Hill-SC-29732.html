Traps are pipes which curve down then back up; they 'trap' a small amount of water to create a water seal between the ambient air space and the inside of the drain system This prevents sewer gas from entering buildings.</p>
<p>When you have a clogged drain, you'd assume that a handy drain cleaner will solve the problem, but that may not the case. The new disposal unit has a connection for the dishwasher, but there is a seal inside that connection.
