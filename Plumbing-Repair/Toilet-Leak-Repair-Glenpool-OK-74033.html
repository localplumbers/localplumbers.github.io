<p>Well not really soften your water because it doesn't remove any dissolved metals, but make your water feel softer and act softer.

Problems can range from leaks to overheating tanks that could burst. Flooding can also lead to wood rot, lowering of the home's market value, and eventual foundation damage.</p>
<p>A sump pump is typically installed at the lowest point of a basement. While it's a useful as a secondary tool in a leak location test, a sewer camera by itself cannot be used to to determine if you have a leak or to find a leak.
