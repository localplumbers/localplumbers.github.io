<p>Family owned and operated since 2003, RT Plumbing Services delivers industry-leading plumbing expertise, home remodeling service, and water heater conversions and replacements to the greater Fort Worth, TX community. Water and electricity use are minimal (according to InSinkerator, disposers account for less than 1 percent of a household's daily water usage, and the total energy cost is about $0.50 per year); the devices don't require much maintenance and often last a decade or more; clogged pipes are rare because scraps are entirely pulverized; almost everything can go down the disposer (veggies, fruit, meat, pizza), and newer models are nearly silent (and not deadly).</p>
<p>Our licensed plumbers will be out to you in no time, and we will have your clogged drain fixed in short order.
