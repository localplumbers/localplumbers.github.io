<p>The name, while maybe confusing today, made sense when it was coined - tree roots used to cause most clogged drains, hence the name ROOTer. Once faucet is removed, clean the sink from putty and mineral deposits by scraping it off (you can use a steel wool). As this water flows into your sump basin, your sump pump collects it and pumps it to where it can be disposed of safely, usually through the sewer system or a sewer-connected drain.</p>
<p>The sewer inspection will easily find any obstructions, clogs, leaks, offset joints, inadequate grade or breakage in the pipes. For sewer lines, these chemicals are rarely effective, and they run the risk of polluting the surrounding area if there is a leak in the pipe underground. Once they're ground, the running water flushes the particles through the grind ring and out of the disposer and into your waste water pipe.</p>
