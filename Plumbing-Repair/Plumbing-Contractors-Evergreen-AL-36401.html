Toilets have the most direct route to the sewer, as well as the biggest drain line.

Once you have an idea of the hardness of your water, calculate your household usage in gallons. A running toilet can use up a large amount of water over a fairly short period, so it is important to get it fixed as soon as possible.

<p>However, water heaters can be susceptible to damage especially when the unit is already past its lifespan or not receiving any maintenance. Pry off the decorative cap if necessary (usually reading Hot” or Cold”), unscrew, and remove the handle.
