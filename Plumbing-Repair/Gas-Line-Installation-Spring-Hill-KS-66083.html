<p>Reverse osmosis (RO) purifiers reject even the tiniest amounts of impurities in tap water making it safe to drink and cook with. After following them on Instagram for a while and seeing how meticulous and precise some of their other systems are in the bus, I was excited to learn about their plumbing and bathroom setup that can handle full-time use by six people.
