Our plumbers are trained weekly on the latest plumbing technology. Look underneath your sink for the pipes that run up. Along those pipes somewhere will be handles that you can turn to shut off the water to your sink. The wastewater carried away by your sewer and drain lines is never meant to be allowed to just seep into the ground.</p>

Sewers and drain lines are an integral part of your home's plumbing system, providing you with the ability to safely remove waste from the home. The hot water may be getting blocked somewhere in the pipes between the water heater and the fixtures.
