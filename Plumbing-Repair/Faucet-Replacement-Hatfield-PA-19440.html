<p>Rinse: The mineral tank is then filled and rinsed with water, the regeneration process is halted and the water softening process repeats itself. How to replace all the parts in a leaky toilet. This is often what we think of in terms of drains—the exits for water at the bottom of your tub or sink. It pays to learn how to toilet works so you can do simple repairs yourself and save money when there is a problem. In this tank, cold water is used to fill the tank, and an element, usually near the top & bottom inside the tank is used to heat it. In between the inside tank and the outer shell is often insulation to help keep the water hot, without the elements having to do all of the work.</p>
