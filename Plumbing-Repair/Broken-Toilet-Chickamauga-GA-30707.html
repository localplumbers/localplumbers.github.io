You might have a plumbed line to a shower head that can be extended out the back door of your skoolie, a sink that swivels out the window to become a shower, a black PVC pipe on the roof that heats water with the sun, a portable propane camp shower, or a solar bag shower. Our state of the art cameras and equipment can pinpoint any blockage or disruption in the sewer and main lines.
