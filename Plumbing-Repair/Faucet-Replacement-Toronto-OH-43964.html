<p>Sewer leaks and drain backups can be caused by pipes that are physically damaged—broken, collapsed, or cracks. Preventative Maintenance Inspection: We provide this service free with any repair or plumbing service. This is one of the most important parts to buying a sump pump system because a good maintenance or service program will check and clean out your sump pump and its parts every year. The cause is often tree roots growing into the sewer pipe or an aging pipe that is disintegrating underground (in both cases, sewage will usually pool on the ground's surface near the problem).</p>
<p>Without access to a septic tank system, your property could quickly become an extremely unpleasant place to be. Once this sump crock becomes filled with water to a certain level, the sump pump will kick in and start pumping water away from your home.

While not a pleasant experience, a hand auger can reach between 2 to 5 feet down the toilet's drain pipe to break-up or retrieve things (such as Junior's action figure) that are blocking the pipe. Another factor that contributes to the cost of the repair is the decision whether the gas line should be extended or should be replaced as a whole.</p>
<p>Caution: Be sure to turn off the power at your circuit breaker or shut off the gas before doing any kind of water heater inspection. Reverse osmosis (RO) is a scientific principle based on the pressure of liquids to remove contaminants from unpurified water. There are advantages as well as disadvantages of water softening.
