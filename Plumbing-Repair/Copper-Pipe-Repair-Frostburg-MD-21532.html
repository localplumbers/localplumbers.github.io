<p>The name, while maybe confusing today, made sense when it was coined - tree roots used to cause most clogged drains, hence the name ROOTer. Once faucet is removed, clean the sink from putty and mineral deposits by scraping it off (you can use a steel wool). As this water flows into your sump basin, your sump pump collects it and pumps it to where it can be disposed of safely, usually through the sewer system or a sewer-connected drain.</p>

Sewage flows to the septic tank, where the primary treatment process takes place. Pedestal Pumps: A pedestal pump is impeller driven, and the motor rests above pit level. Most folks who live in rural areas probably have a septic system instead of a sewer connection , but septic systems are in place all over the nation.</p>
