<p>Did you know that water heater problems are one of the most common reasons to call a plumber?

Of course, pumps alone are no replacement for properly installed and serviced footer drains, which will also move water away from your foundation if they are clear of debris and operating properly.

<p>From toys to excessive toilet paper, toilet drain clogs may need more help than just a plunger. Every month, flush your drains with a mixture of hot water, baking soda, and vinegar. Residential reverse osmosis systems typically incorporate a combination of conventional filtration to remove sediment and other solids, followed by activated carbon adsorption for the removal of organic compounds, chlorine, pesticides and VOC's, prior to the reverse osmosis membrane.</p>
