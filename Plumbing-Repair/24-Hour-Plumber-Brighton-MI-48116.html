<p>If this component malfunctions, you may lose control of the heating or cooling capacity of the unit. This condition can be dangerous, both because hot water and steam can scald people, and because the water heater could rupture from excess pressure.

Regular water heater maintenance can also extend the life of the appliance and help prevent unexpected leaks or other problems.</p>
<p>The size of the septic tank system needed depends on the size of your home and the number of people living there; a 6-bedroom home, for example, requires a much larger system than a 2-bedroom home.
