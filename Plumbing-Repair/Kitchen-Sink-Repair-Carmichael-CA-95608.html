Whether or not you need a sump pump as part of your septic system installation is dependent on where the system is located in relation to the building.</p>
<p>Next look under each sink with a flash light while the water is running and make sure there are no leaks at supply lines and drain. In heavily trafficked areas, shifts in the ground or the weight of the soil can offset drain lines and cause misalignment around pipe joints, break seals between pipes, or cause sewer lines to collapse in on themselves.

Sewer inspections are particularly necessary if you're buying an older home or a home that's surrounded by a lot of trees. This will help you avoid unnecessary services such as high-pressure sewer jets.
