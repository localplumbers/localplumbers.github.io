It is critical that this method is performed by a professional only and cannot be used on pipes that are not strong enough to withstand the pressure.

<p>Each ppm of iron is equivalent to 3 to 4 grains of water hardness, and it is recommended that an ion-exchange water softener should only be used for iron removal if its concentration in the water does not exceed 5 to 6ppm, otherwise an iron filter should be used in conjunction with the water softener.
