Acid injection prevents calcium carbonate scale formation, but leads to an extremely high concentration of CO2, which is not removed by the RO system and places a high removal demand on downstream ion exchange processes. A camera inspection can uncover all types of problems including tree roots growing into the main sewer lines, pipe narrowing due to limescale buildup, and pipe corrosion.</p>
<p>Without access to a septic tank system, your property could quickly become an extremely unpleasant place to be. Once this sump crock becomes filled with water to a certain level, the sump pump will kick in and start pumping water away from your home. With this much flow loss, routine cleaning may not be effective in restoring the membrane performance especially in cases of organic fouling, biofouling, colloidal fouling, sulfate scaling and calcium fluoride scaling.</p>
