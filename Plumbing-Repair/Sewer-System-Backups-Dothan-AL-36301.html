Turn off the supply water, flush it, sponge out as much water as you can from the tank and from the bowl, loosen the t-bolts off, loosen off the supply tube, lift the toilet off the floor, turning it upside down beside you, scrape off the old wax seal from it and from the floor, remove the old t-bolts, put in new t-bolts, and wax ring, set toilet down on top of the flange, press gently to the floor allowing the wax to create a seal, tighten t-bolts, go from one bolt to the other 5 ¼ turns each, DO NOT OVER TIGHTEN, hook up the supply tube, turn on water, flush toilet, check for leaks.</p>

<p>You will need to know what voltage your water heater is. While is seems like common sense to tell you, make sure you turn off the circuit breakers if you will be installing any electrical connections.
