<p>Homeowners dread the money when they need to face plumbing problem and call the help of professional plumbers. They reported: 1. certain naturally occurring Gram- negative bacteria can multiply in relatively pure RO water; 2. thorough periodic disinfection of the entire RO system is essential in producing water with acceptable bacterial counts; 3. stagnant water in pipes down stream of the membrane is the major source of bacteria and endotoxin in the product water; and 4. the efficiency of a membrane in rejecting bacteria is better in continuous operation than in intermittent use.</p>
<p>As in clogged toilets, the kitchen sink may also be clogged and the water would not drain due to rusty drain pipes.
