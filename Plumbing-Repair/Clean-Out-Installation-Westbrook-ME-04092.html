<p>A sewer that is root-infested or broken, or flat, can contribute to a major clog that backs up into a home or business establishment resulting in thousands of dollars in damage, repairs, and loss in property value.

All waste water tries to get to the main sewer line and so all drain pipes flow that way.</p>
