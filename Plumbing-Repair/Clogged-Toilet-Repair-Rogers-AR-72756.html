<p>Reverse osmosis purification systems were originally created for large scale treatment facilities, mobile army units and the food industry. After the problem has been addressed, a follow-up sewer line video inspection can confirm that the problem is solved and give you peace of mind. Should a problem occur or our technician detect a problem with the p-trap or plumbing drain line (household sewer system), he or she will recommend the services of a licensed plumber.</p>

Reduced Energy Consumption - Unlike traditional reverse osmosis systems that operate at constant high pressure, Desalitech systems start each batch at a low pressure which is gradually increased during the batch as concentration in the systems builds up. This leads to an average pressure which is lower than the constant pressure of traditional reverse osmosis.</p>
<p>Water can be naturally soft (water supplies derived from lakes and streams are often naturally soft); or it can be soft due to artificial treatment, either at the municipal water utility company, or by means of an in-house water treatment appliance known as a water softener. One of the ways we are able to do this is by utilizing state-of-the-art cameras to peek inside our customers' pipes and drains, providing us with a comprehensive overview of their condition along with any issues that may be present.</p>
<p>When you need a gas line or appliance installed, or you need repairs to a gas line, stove or heater, it's not a time to take chances. Heating systems harness electric or even solar energy.

The simple definition of hard water is ‘water that contains a large amount of minerals in it'.</p>
