A Kinetico water softener will provide your family with abundant, clean, safe water on demand. If your well has sediment or particulate matter, high concentrations of iron, or bacteria, you will want to make sure that it is eliminated from the water before it reaches the reverse osmosis membrane to ensure optimal performance.</p>
