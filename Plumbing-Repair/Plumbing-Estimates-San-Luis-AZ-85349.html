The more expensive ones often boast more stages (which refers to the number of filters used), the ability to filter larger quantities of water at a time, and extra features like autoflush.</p>
<p>A clog in your plumbing often affects a single sink, tub, shower or toilet, but if more than one fixture is backed up, you may need to clean out the main drain line. The rectangular space-saving shape also makes it easy for contractors to install up to three pumps in the pit.
