<p>Most of the time each septic system design has a drainage field already specified but in some cases exceptions need to be made.

Septic tanks do not require any real hands on maintenance except of course unless they break down. In reverse osmosis, pressure is exerted on the side with the concentrated solution to force the water molecules across the membrane to the fresh water side.</p>
