<p>The only time most people really spend thinking about their water heaters is in the middle of winter, when they get up in the dark to take a hot shower and they're blasted with a jet of icy water. With modern video equipment, the interior of the pipe may be inspected - this is a form of non-destructive testing A small diameter collector pipe will typically have a cleanout access at the far end and will be several hundred feet long, terminating at a manhole Additional collector pipes may discharge at this manhole and a pipe (perhaps of larger diameter) will carry the effluent to the next manhole, and so forth to a pump station or treatment plant.</p>
