<h2>How To Hire Certified Plumbing Contractor in Bridgeport</h2>
<p>Homeowners and businesses alike experience plumbing complications such as pipes bursting as the seasons change. Check the building drain-vent system: if there is not an obvious drain blockage, and if drains are slow, particularly if you hear a "gurgling" sound at fixtures during draining, I'd suspect that the building vent system is incomplete, improperly installed, or has become blocked (perhaps by an animal or an insect nest, or in northern climates, by snow if the above-roof extension is too short, or by ice if the vent is too small in diameter - rising steam condenses and freezes in the outside portion of the vent).</p>
