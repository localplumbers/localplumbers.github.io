For some sensitive septic systems even toilet paper can cause costly clogs.</p>
<p>The size of the septic tank system needed depends on the size of your home and the number of people living there; a 6-bedroom home, for example, requires a much larger system than a 2-bedroom home.

Since many sump pumps are used for bad weather, they should be hooked up to a sump pump battery backup. In these instances, it is better just to contact a plumber and replace the drain completely.
