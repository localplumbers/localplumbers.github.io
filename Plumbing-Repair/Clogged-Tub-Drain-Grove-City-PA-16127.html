<p>Your home plumbing system comprises of three basic components - your clean water supply, drainage system as well as appliances and fixtures. These drains get all kind of dirt, dust, leafs and debris (all kinds), and will clog these drains.

Whenever something goes out through the drainage lines in our homes, it goes to the septic tank initially.</p>
