<p>Purchasing a hot water for the home is something that a lot of people will have to do in their lives. You might have a plumbed line to a shower head that can be extended out the back door of your skoolie, a sink that swivels out the window to become a shower, a black PVC pipe on the roof that heats water with the sun, a portable propane camp shower, or a solar bag shower. Our state of the art cameras and equipment can pinpoint any blockage or disruption in the sewer and main lines.

The controls can also be used to manage multiple systems simultaneously, effectively making a one-man water production plant.
