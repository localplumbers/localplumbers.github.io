<p>Purchasing a hot water for the home is something that a lot of people will have to do in their lives. You might have a plumbed line to a shower head that can be extended out the back door of your skoolie, a sink that swivels out the window to become a shower, a black PVC pipe on the roof that heats water with the sun, a portable propane camp shower, or a solar bag shower.

The controls can also be used to manage multiple systems simultaneously, effectively making a one-man water production plant.
