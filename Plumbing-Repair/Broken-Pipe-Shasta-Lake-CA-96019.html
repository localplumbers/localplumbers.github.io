<p>A faucet is a gadget that controls the stream of water from a pipe. When your drains start to slow down, most home owners and business owners will quickly run to drain cleaners and chemical-based products to unclog their pipes and plumbing system. Basement Waterproofing more often than not involves some sort of concrete or foundation repair. For a run-of-the-mill lavatory faucet, West says, the answer's probably no.

<p>There truly are many factors at play when it comes to bathtub plumbing troubleshooting, it can leave even the most seasoned DIY homeowner befuddled when there's a problem. The plumbing lines run upward through the wall to the basement ceiling and connect to the sewer or septic tank line there.

<p>The wave of gas and water act as a battering ram to push the blockage through the pipe. Shut off water supply, and remove faucet handle held to main body of faucet by unscrewing tiny screw on top or at back of handle. Indeed, when clogs are happening simultaneously in your home, it probably means the clogging is deeper into the drainage system, far along in the sewer line where it can slow multiple drains. Alternatively, if a pump chamber system is being installed, a small chamber next to the where the septic tank will lay should be excavated.</p>
