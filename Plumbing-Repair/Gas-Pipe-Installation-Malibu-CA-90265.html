<p>Reverse Osmosis can be used to produce the water needed in the initial part of the process and also at the the end of the process where the waste water can be processed again using RO. Once the water is cleaned and the waste products removed and disposed of correctly rather than just flushed away, it can then be reused in the production process, reducing waste and usage of water. Water softening can prevent these negative effects.</p>
