Pressure is applied to the solution with a higher solids concentration to cause the flow of liquid to reverse (from concentrate to permeate), unlike natural osmosis.

They have been replaced by more efficient, more effective multi-stage filtration units that can outperform the RO units and provide years of clean, pure, healthy water.</p>
