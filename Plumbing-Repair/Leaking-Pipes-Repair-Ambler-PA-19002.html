Eventually, these backed-up pipes will become burst pipes, which should be avoided at all costs as they are classified as plumbing emergencies and can cause a significant amount of damage in no time at all.</p>
<p>When the disposer is switched on, impellers are activated to throw the food against a shredder ring similar to a cheese grater to pulverize it. Cold water from the faucet flushes out the waste.
