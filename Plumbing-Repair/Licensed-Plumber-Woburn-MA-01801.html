<p>Fortunately, there are several proven drain cleaning methods that can help to get rid of those pesky clogs. The water will also go through remineralization at 2 points, before the storage tank and before it travels to the faucet, where a small amount of healthy minerals are added to increase its alkalinity and give back the natural sweetness to the water. Usually, there is a partial rubber closure, known as a splashguard, on the top of the disposal unit to prevent food waste from flying back up out of the grinding chamber.</p>
